Preface
</h2>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
This volume can hardly be said to have been written: it came
about. The little tour in the South of France which is responsible
for its existence, happened some years ago, and was undertaken for
various reasons, health and rest among others, and the very last
idea which served as a motive for the journey was that of writing
about the country whose history is so voluminous and so incalculably
ancient. Nobody but a historian and a scholar already
deeply versed in the subject could dream of attempting to treat it
in any serious or complete fashion. But this fact did not prevent
the country from instantly making a profound and singular impression
upon a mind entirely unprepared by special study or knowledge
to be thus stirred. The vividness of the impression, therefore,
was not to be accounted for by associations of facts and scenes already
formed in the imagination. True, many an incident of history and
romance now found its scene and background, but before these
corresponding parts of the puzzle had been fitted together the potent
charm had penetrated, giving that strange, baffling sense of home-coming
which certain lands and places have for certain minds,
remaining for ever mysterious, yet for ever familiar as some haunt
of early childhood.
</p>

<p>
An experience of that sort will not, as a rule, allow itself to be set
aside. It works and troubles and urges, until, sooner or later, some
form of transmutation must take place, some condensing into form
of the formless, some passing of impulse into expression, be it what
it may.
</p>

<p>
And thus the first stray notes and sketches were made without
ultimate intention. But the charm imposed itself, and the notes
grew and grew. Then a more definite curiosity awoke and gradually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
the scene widened: history and imagination took sisterly hands
and whispered suggestions, explanations of the secret of the
extraordinary magic, till finally the desultory sketches began to
demand something of order in their undrilled ranks. The real toil
then began.
</p>

<p>
The subject, once touched upon, however slightly, is so unendingly
vast and many-sided, so entangled with scholarly controversy, that
the few words possible to say in a volume of this kind seem but
to cause obscurity, and worst of all, to falsify the general balance
of impression because of the innumerable other things that must
perforce be left unsaid. An uneasy struggle is set up in the mind to
avoid, if possible, that most fatal sort of misrepresentation, viz.,
that which contains a certain proportion of truth.
</p>

<p>
And how to choose among varying accounts and theories, one
contradicting the other? Authorities differ on important points as
radically and as surely as they differ about the spelling of the names
of persons and places. There is conflict even as to the names in use
at the present day, as, for instance, the little mountain range of
the Alpilles, which some writers persistently spell <i>Alpines</i>, out of
pure pigheadedness or desire to make themselves conspicuous, as it
seems to the weary seeker after textual consistency. Where doctors
disagree what can one do who is not a doctor, but try to give a
general impression of the whole matter and leave the rest to
the gods?
</p>

<p>
As for dates&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
Now there are two things with which no one who has not been
marked out by Providence by a special and triumphant gift ought to
dream of attempting to deal, namely, dates and keys&mdash;between which
evanescent, elusive and fundamentally absurd entities there is a subtle
and deep-seated affinity. If meddled with at all, they must be treated
in a large spirit: no meticulous analysis; no pursuit of a pettifogging
date sharpening the point of accuracy down to a paltry twelve
months. And correspondingly, as regards the smaller kind of keys,
no one who values length of days should ever touch them! They are
the vehicles of demoniac powers. Of course the good, quiet, well-developed
cellar or stable-door key is another matter; and thus (to
pursue the parallel) dates can be dealt with in a broadly synthetic
fashion, in centuries and group of centuries, so that while the author
gains in peace of mind, the reader is spared the painful experience
of being stalked and hunted from page to page, and confronted
round every corner by quartets of dreary figures, minutely defining
moments of time which are about as much to him as they are
to Hecuba!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The chronology in this volume, therefore, may be described as
frugal rather than generous in character, but what there is of it is
handled in the "grand manner."
</p>

<p>
Such, then, is the history of the volume which still retains the
character of its irregular origin. Historically it attempts nothing
but the roughest outline of the salient points of the story about
which a traveller interested in the subject at all is at once curious
for information. The one thing on which it lays stress is the quality
of the country as distinguished from its outward features. For to
many (for example, to our severe critic whose impressions are
recorded in Chapter III.) these external features are devoid of all
attraction. It is necessary to keep this fact in mind.
</p>

<p>
A wide plain bounded by mountains of moderate height and an
insignificant chain of bare limestone hills (the Alpilles); cities
ancient indeed, but small, shabby, not too clean, with dingy old
hotels, and no particular advantages of situation&mdash;such a description
of Provence would be accurate for those who are not among its
enthusiasts. To traverse the country in an express train, especially
with the eyes still full of the more obvious beauties of the Pyrenees
and the Alps, is to see all the wonder of the land of the troubadours
reduced to the mere flatness of a map. In a few minutes the
"rapide" had darted past some of its most ancient and romantic
cities&mdash;quiet and simple they stand, merged into the very soil, with
no large or striking features to catch the eye; only a patch of grey
masonry in the landscape and a few towers upon the horizon, easily
missed in the quick rush of the train.
</p>

<p>
A deeper sound in the rumble of the flying wheels for a couple
of minutes announces the crossing of some river: long stretches
of waste land, covered for miles and miles with sunburnt stones,
and again stretches of country, low-lying, God-forsaken, scarcely
cultivated, with a few stunted, melancholy trees, a farmstead on the
outskirts here and there: these are the "features of the country,"
as they might be described without departure from bare, literal, all-deceiving
fact.
</p>

<p>
How many travellers of the thousands who pass along this line
every year are interested in such a scene or guess its profound and
multitudinous experiences? How many realise as they rattle past,
that in this arid land of the vine and the cypress were born and
fostered the sentiments, the unwritten laws and traditions on which
is built all that we understand by civilised life? How many say to
themselves as they pass: "But for the men and women who dreamt
and sang and suffered in this Cradle of Chivalry, the world that
I live in would never have been born, the thoughts I think and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
emotions to which I am heir would never have arisen out of the
darkness?"
</p>

<p>
But, indeed, the strange, many-sided country gives little aid or
suggestion for such realisations: it has reticently covered itself with
a mantle; it seems to crouch down out of sight while the monster
engine thunders by with its freight of preoccupied passengers.
</p>

<p>
A bare, flat, sun-scorched land.
</p>

<p>
Yes, these are the "facts," but ah! how different from the magic
truth!
</p>

<p>
With facts, therefore, this volume has only incidentally to do. It
is a "true and veracious history," but by no means a literal one.
As to the mere accidents of travel, these are treated lightly. Exactly
in which order the cities were visited no reader need count upon
certainly knowing&mdash;and indeed it concerns him nothing&mdash;when and
where the observations were made by "Barbara," or the "severe
critic," or the landlady of the Hotel de Provence and so forth, the
following pages may or may not accurately inform him (with the
exception, indeed, of the curious, self-revelation of Raphael of
Tarascon, which is given almost word for word as it occurred, for
here accident and essence chanced to coincide); but he may be sure
that though Barbara possibly did not speak or act as represented
then and there, she did or might have so spoken or acted elsewhere
and at another time. The irrelevancies of chance and incident have
been ignored in the interests of the essential. Barbara may not
recognise all her observations when she sees them. <i>Tant pis pour
Barbara!</i> They are true in the spirit if not in the letter. And
so throughout.
</p>

<p>
From the moment that the original "notes" began to be written,
the one and sole impulse and desire has been to suggest, to hint to
the imagination that which can never be really told of the poetry,
the idealism, the glory, the sadness, and the great joy of this
wondrous land of Sun and Wind and Dream.

CHAPTER I
</p>

<p class="center">
THE SPELL OF PROVENCE
</p>

<p>
During the night there was a great and unexplained
tumult: rustling sounds in the little courtyard to which
our rooms looked out; whisperings along the corridors;
distant bangings; footsteps, voices&mdash;or was it the
remaining rumours of a dream?
</p>

<p>
Then a great sigh and a surging among the shrubs in
the courtyard. The creepers sway against the windows,
and something seems to sweep through the room. Presently
a rush and a rattle among the jalousies, and a high
scream as of some great angry creature flying with frantic
wings over the courtyard and across the sky.
</p>

<p>
The mistral!
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking our visitor.
</p>

<p>
A great angry creature, indeed, and no one who has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
seen the Land of the Sun and Wind only under the sway
of the more benign power can have any conception of
the passion and storm of this mighty Brigand of the
Mountain.
</p>

<p>
We begin now to understand the meaning of the
epithet, "windy Avignon." And if one considers its
position on the plain of the Rhone and the Durance&mdash;the
country stretching south and east to the
mysterious stony desert of the Crau<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> and the great
regions of the mouths of the Rhone&mdash;it is easy to see
how the Black Wind, rushing down from his home in
the ranges of Mont Ventoux and the Luberon, must
sweep the streets of the city and fill every nook and
corner with whirl and trouble.
</p>

<p>
The Rhone that "bends round Avignon to salute Our
Lady on her high rock," as Mistral proclaims, grows
white with anger under the lash, noble river that she is!
</p>

<p>
Round farmstead and garden, along her banks, and far
away on the great spaces of this wonderful country, long,
tall rows of cypresses keep guard over house and home;
for only these steadfast trees of Wisdom and of Sorrow can
stand against the fury of the mistral. For unnumbered
ages, long, long before all human history or tradition, he
has lorded it over the country, descending after the
fashion of the ancient Ligurian inhabitants from the
hill-tops, for raid and ravage in the valleys.
</p>

<p>
Many have been his victims from first to last; among
them the daughter to whom Madame de Sévigné addresses
her famous letters. She suffers from his
onslaught upon her Provençal château of Grignan,
which was nearly destroyed by the monster; unless,
indeed, the lady is romancing a little to keep her lively
mother amused and quiet; for Madame de Sévigné
writes: "Vous dépeignez cette horreur comme Virgile!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A householder seriously damaged in his property would
be most unlikely to describe the disaster thus classically.
Perhaps a chimney or two blown off and a roof carried
away may have stimulated Madame de Grignan's fancy.
There were always those letters to be written and a
certain dearth of subjects for a lady besieged by the
mistral in a Provençal château. What Madame de
Grignan must have said one gathers from the mother's
reply&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Voila le vent, le tourbillon, l'ouragon, les diables
déchainés, qui veulent emporter votre château.... Ah
ma fille, quelle ébranlement universel!"
</p>

<p>
The mother recommends taking refuge in Avignon; a
curious place to flee to from such a foe! But in those
days there was no swift flight possible, and a removal
from the howling country to the whistling town was all
that could be achieved even by the wealthy. One
wonders how the removal of a household was effected
when there were no railways and probably few roads&mdash;and
a mistral at full tilt across the plains!
</p>

<p>
Poets of all ages have sung of the feats of the amazing
wind, and there are descriptions of its furious descent
upon the Crau, where in default of anything better to
wreak its anger upon, it sends the stones hurling across
the plain. Nothing can stand against it. Mistral says
that in tempest "il souffle toujours. Les arbres ... se
courbent, se secouent à arracher leurs troncs."
</p>

<p>
The ancients assigned a place to the great wind
among their deities, and the Emperor Augustus erected
a temple in its honour. It is curious how this pagan
feeling of personality in the wind survives to this day.
</p>

<p>
Its famous namesake, the Provençal poet, whose home
is at Maillane, on the great plain among the guardian
cypresses, expresses the sentiment in a hundred forms,
and he adduces a still more striking instance in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
account he once gave of his father&mdash;a fine specimen of
the Provençal farmer or yeoman&mdash;who had a positive
adoration for "le bon vent."

"Le jour ou l'on vannait le blé, souvent il n'y avait
pas un souffle d'air pour emporter la poussière blonde,
alors, mon père avait recours a une sorte d'invocation
au mistral.
</p>

<p>
"Souffle mon mignon, disait il, et il priait et
implorait.
</p>

<p>
"Eh bien, le vent venait et mon père, etait plein de
joie, et il criait 'brava, brava.'"
</p>

<p>
In his house at Maillane, protected from foreign
intrusion by the double army of the winds and the
mosquitos, this chief of the Félibres passes his days,
rejoicing in their scourges because they frighten away
the wandering tourist&mdash;"tempted by our horizons and
our sky"&mdash;from the land of the Sun and the Cypress.
</p>

<p>
To him the roar and shriek of the mistral is always
a "musico majestuoso."
</p>

<p>
This tremendous being (as indeed he seems when one
has once felt the very earth shaking beneath his assault)
must be responsible for much in the Provençal character
and literature; it is impossible to believe it to have been
without profound influence on the imagination of the
many races that have made the country their home.
</p>

<p>
Its voice is elemental, passionate, sometimes expressing
blind fury, but often full of an agony that even its own
tremendous cry cannot utter; a torment as of Prometheus
and a grandeur of spirit no less than his.
</p>

<p>
The mistral produces effects of astonishing contrast;
for when he is silent Provence is the most smiling, kindly
land in the world; and half its stories are of gentle
and lovely things: of chivalry, of romance, of dance and
song and laughter. But when once the Black Wind
begins to rouse himself from his lair on Mont Ventoux,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
then tragedy and pain and despair are abroad on wide
dark wings.
</p>

<p class="p2">
All the "merry hamlets" of Provence have delightful
courts or <i>places</i> shaded with plane-trees. Here the villagers
assemble on Sundays and Saints' days, and here
may always be found a few happy loungers resting on
the benches, or playing some game of whose mysterious
antiquity they are blissfully unconscious.
</p>

<p>
It is the country of mediævalism; it is still more
the country of paganism, of Greek temples, Phœnician
inscriptions and tombs, Roman baths, amphitheatres,
aqueducts; it boasts a profusion of exquisite churches,
splendid mediæval castles; scenes of troubadour history,
of the reputed Courts of Love; of a thousand traditions
and stories that have become the heritage of every
civilised people.
</p>

<p>
In the valley of Elorn, near Landerneau&mdash;called the
Cradle of Chivalry&mdash;was found, according to the legend,
the veritable round table of King Arthur, and here rose
into the sky the towers of the Château de Joyeuse Garde
of the Arthurian legends.
</p>

<p>
But Provence rests its claim to having been the birthplace
of Chivalry on better grounds than this, for the
first troubadour was a Provençal, the Comte Quilhelm
de Poictier; a most <i>debonnaire</i> gentleman, of attractive
appearance, courtly manners, and an exhaustive knowledge
of the Gay Science, making great havoc with
the hearts of ladies.
</p>

<p>
The colour of the landscape in Provence is as vivid
as the history of its people.
</p>

<p>
A writer speaks of "la couleur violente, presque
exaspérée, des montagnes."
</p>

<p>
There is no country that can be less conveyed to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
imagination by an enumeration of topographical facts.
The more exact the description the less we arrive at the
land that Mistral sees and loves.
</p>

<p>
Of this poet, characteristically Provençal, Lamartine is
reported to have said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I bring you glad tidings, a great epic poet is born
among us. The West produces no more such poets, but
from the nature of the South they will spring forth. It
is from the sun alone that power flows."
</p>

<p>
It is from the sun that <i>life</i> flows, is the irresistible
conclusion that one comes to under the skies of the Midi.
</p>

<p>
Science has insisted upon the fact, and no one seriously
disputes it, but not to dispute and to actually accept are
two very different conditions of mind. Legend, proverb,
history, song, all seem to tell of a life more intense, more
"vibrant," as their great poet describes the Provençals&mdash;in
the troubadour country than elsewhere; unless indeed
one goes still farther into the regions of the sun and
falls under the kindred spell of Italy.
</p>

<p>
In England archæology seems cold and dead. In the
South it conjures up visions of a teeming life; generation
after generation of peoples, race after race, civilisation
after civilisation.
</p>

<p>
Paradox as it seems, the multitude of dead or ruined
or vanished cities that have lined the coast from the
Pyrenees to the Var strangely enhances this sense of
vitality and persistence of human activities.
</p>

<p class="p2">
But one records and records, and yet one has not
Provence. One has but her mountains and contours,
her blue sky, and perhaps her wild wind&mdash;but there is
always something beyond.
</p>

<p>
One sees the Rhone and the Durance on their way to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
the sea&mdash;splendid headlong rivers; one sees the melancholy
brooding wilderness of the Crau, where Hercules
and the quarrelsome Titans flung those huge stones at
one another in the dim old days; one sees always the
strange, fantastic little limestone chain of the Alpilles
which finishes to the south-east the great semicircle
begun to the west by the higher ranges. The eye follows
everywhere, fascinated, the battalions of cypresses, while
over all is the flooding light, vibrating, living. And yet
after all is said, Provence is still an unknown land.
</p>

<p>
It is one of the haunted lands, the spell-weaving lands.
It enslaves as no obvious technical beauty of landscape
can enslave.
</p>

<p>
Provence is like one of its own enchanting ladies of the
troubadour days, and strangely significant is it that this
nameless quality of the country should have been thus
reproduced by the crown and flower of its people. For
this attribute of charm belongs to knight and baron,
soldier and singer, if we may trust the old songs and
the old stories. But, <i>par excellence</i>, it belonged to the
cultivated lady of the epoch. Take, for instance, the
mysterious Countess of Die or Dia, of whose identity
nothing is certainly known. She was a writer of songs
and the heroine of one of the poetical love-stories of the
age: a lady capable of deep and faithful love, unhappily
for her peace of mind. Of the subtlety of her attractions
one may judge by the power which the mere dead records
wield to this day over the imagination. This is how
a modern author writes of her&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Her voice had the colour of Alban wine, with overtones like the
gleams of light in the still, velvety depths of the goblet, and when she
smiled, it seemed as if she drew from a harp a slow, deep chord in the
mode of Æolia. Though not at all diffident, and not at all prudish,
she wore usually an air of shyness, the shyness of one whose thoughts
dread intrusion."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
How our author managed to gather such intimate
detail from ancient volumes is perhaps difficult to understand;
and doubtless he has reconstructed a voice and
a smile from hints of the personality given by musty
documents written demurely in the quaint, beautiful old
<i>langue d'oc</i>. Still, there must have been some potent
suggestion in the chronicles to set the fancy working
in this glowing way, and it is a fact that all that one
reads of the women of that time has a curious elusive
element, producing an impression of some attraction
subtler and more holding than can be expressed in direct
words.
</p>

<p>
And Provence has a charm like that of her mysteriously
endowed women; unaccountable, but endless to those
who are once drawn within the magnetic circle. Have
their sisters of to-day none of this quality? One here
and there, no doubt, but it is to be feared that modern
conditions do not favour the production of the type.
Perhaps the women of to-day are making a <i>détour</i> out
of the region of enchantment, but only in order to
obtain a broader, more generous grasp of the things
of life. Some day they will give back to mankind
what has been taken away by the new adventures,
and when the tide turns, there will surely pour over
the arid world a flood of beauty and "youngheartedness"
and romance such as the blinder, less conscious
centuries have never so much as dreamt of!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the troubadours had the privilege of
dedicating their songs and their hearts to the most
fascinating women which civilisation had as yet produced.
Perhaps one associates such subtle attraction
with the powers of darkness, but there is nothing to
show that such powers had aught to do with the charm
of the heroines of troubadour song. On the contrary,
they seem as a rule to have been of extremely fine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
calibre; and if one consults one's memories of magnetic
personalities&mdash;after all there are not a very large array
of them&mdash;it almost always proves to be the powers of
good in its broadest sense, and not of evil, that give
birth to the fascination that never dies.
</p>

<p>
And the fascination of this gay, sad, brilliant,
sympathetic country is not dreadful and diabolic. It
is compounded of wholesome sunshine and merriment,
swift ardour of thought and emotion, of beautiful
manners; of the poetry of ancient industries: of sowing
and reaping and tillage; of wine-culture and olive-growing;
of legends and quaint proverbs, and a language
full of the flavour of the soil and the sun that reveals
itself to the quick of ear and of heart long before it can
be fully understood. For it appeals to the heart, this
sweet language of the troubadours, and hard must have
often been the task of those poor ladies, wooed in this too
winning tongue!
</p>

<p>
The traditions of chivalry are among the priceless
possessions of the human race, and it is in Provence
that their aroma lingers with a potency scarcely to be
found in any other country. The air is alive with rich
influences. The heat of the sun, the extraordinary
brilliance of light and colour, the dignity of an ancient
realm whose every inch is penetrated with human doings
and destinies, all combine towards an enchantment that
belongs to the mysterious side of nature and prompts
a host of unanswerable questions. The eye wanders
bewildered across the country, wistfully struggling to
realise the wonder and the beauty. It sweeps the peaked
line of mountains with only an added sense of bafflement,
and rests at last, sadly, on some lonely castle with
shattered ramparts and roofless banqueting-hall, where
now only the birds sing troubadour songs, and ivy and
wild vines are the swaying tapestries.

CHAPTER II
</p>

<p class="center">AVIGNON
</p>

<p>
How the sun does pour down on to the great esplanade
before the Palace of the Popes! It is as warm as a June
day in England and twice as light. That astounding
building towers into the blue, bare and creamy white,
every stern, simple line of it ascending swift and clear,
in repeated strokes, rhythmically grand, like some fine
piece of blank verse.
</p>

<p>
The parapet alone shows broken surfaces. Neither
cornice nor corbel nor window pediment; scarcely a
window to interrupt the mass of splendid masonry, only
recurrent shafts of stone (continuing from the machicolations
above) which shoot straight and slim from base to
summit of the fortress, to meet there at intervals, as
if a line of tall poplars, two by two, had bent their
heads together to form this succession of sharply-pointed
arches.
</p>

<p>
The arrangement of massive wall and slender arch
gives to the building a singular effect of strength and
eternity combined with a severe sort of grace.
</p>

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
It stands there enormous, calm, yet with a delicacy
of bearing belonging surely to no other edifice of that
impregnable strength and vast bulk. The genius of the
architect has expressed in these sixteen-feet walls some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
of the spirit of the palace as well as the rudeness of the
stronghold, and has given a subtle hint of the painted
halls and galleries wherein half the potentates of Europe
were magnificently entertained, where Petrarch dreamed
and Rabelais jested.... And that hint seems to lie in
the general relations of mass to mass, and especially in
the shallow projection and towering height of that endless
line of delicate arches. Burke, in his sublime way,
assures us that sublimity is the result of monotonous
repetition, and this surprising achievement of Papal
magnificence certainly bears out the theory.
</p>

<p>
The palace shows no more signs of age upon it than
the glowing tint of the walls through the beating of the
sun upon them for hundreds of brilliant years. How
brilliant they must have been! What warmth, what
light! That is what astonishes Barbara: the light.
She cannot get over it. We seem to have awakened
into a world woven out of radiance.
</p>

<p>
Not but that it is a very real and solid world, this
sun-created realm of rambling terraces and upward-trending
pathways. Rich stone-pines follow the slant
of the road, as it mounts the famous Rocher du Dom
in easy zig-zags till it reaches the plateau at the
summit, where once upon a time, tradition says, all
the witches and wizards of the country-side used to
celebrate their unholy rites. And thereby hangs a tale&mdash;perhaps
to be told later in the day.
</p>

<p>
Half-way up the rock, on a little platform of its own,
stands a small Romanesque Cathedral, singularly fine in
style, and characteristic of the architecture of the South
of France. Creepers are hanging recklessly, alluringly
over the walls and parapets of the hill above. On the
top there is a little garden, with seats and shrubs and a
pond inhabited by ornate, self-conscious kinds of birds.
We learn this in later explorations. Just now the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
instinctive human desire to reach the highest point
achievable is half quieted by the warm comfort of this
placid spot below, and we turn our backs on the aspiring
Mount.
</p>

<p>
There are sun-warmed stone benches under the young,
sparsely-covered plane-trees (no town in Provence ever
dreamt of trying to exist without plane-trees), and here
we establish ourselves and watch the little events of the
square: the soldiers coming and going up the steps of
the Papal Palace (now a barracks); the three recruits
being frantically drilled (there is always an element of
frenzy in French military exercises); the slow moving
of the shadows which rudely caricature the huge stone
garland on the Papal Mint, a design in Michael Angelo's
most opulent manner; the stray cats on the prowl from
neighbouring kitchens; the cheerful dog trotting across
the square, tail in air, ready to answer to a friendly word
with which we detain him from more important affairs.
</p>

<p>
Ancient as is this city of the Popes, there are no
weather-stains, as we northerners understand them, only
marks of the sun and wind. A good friend this fierce,
cleansing sun, and the wind from Mont Ventoux must
sweep away all impurities from the narrow streets, and&mdash;<i>il
y en a!</i>
</p>

<p>
Away across the parapet a mass of roofs fills the slope
to the river bank&mdash;most wonderful of rivers!&mdash;and to the
south there are hills and bright distances: Provençal
hills, distances of the land of "joy, young-heartedness
and love." And that makes the thought that we are
in Provence wake up with a cry that rings in the heart
like a <i>reveillé</i>. And on its heels comes a strange, secret
rebound of sadness, keen as the cut of a knife. As for
the cause? Who can say exactly what home-sickness,
what vast longing it is that wakens thus when the beauty
and greatness of the world and the narrowness of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
individual possibilities point too clearly their eternal
contrast?

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
"I can't get over that <i>light</i>," Barbara exclaims, in
renewed astonishment. "I don't feel as if I ever wanted
to move from this bench."
</p>

<p>
And we let the sun make a considerable portion of his
daily journey across the palace walls before we move.
Already the influence of the South is in our veins. It
makes one better understand the genius of this "Rome
transportée dans les Gaules." It must have been, in
some sort, the capital of Europe, when for sixty years
or so the Papal Court drew the great and the famous
from the ends of the earth to the gay, corrupt little city.
</p>

<p>
Seven Popes reigned here, but of the life at the Palace
during that time there is singularly little record. Instinctively
one tries to recapture misty reminiscences of
schoolroom lore, for now the dry facts begin to glow with
the splendour and the pathos of real life, as one realises
that just on this very spot, in sight of these sunny hills
and this rushing river, those ancient things took place.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! Barbara, how magnificently learned I should
be if only I possessed all the information that I have
forgotten!"
</p>

<p>
"What have you forgotten?" Barbara inquires
soothingly.
</p>

<p>
Heavens! What with forgetting and never having
known, one felt as arid and futile as an extinct volcano.
Had one but enjoyed the privileges accorded to the
characters of ancient drama, one would have stretched
forth hands in invocation to the mysterious eventful city.
</p>

<p>
"O city, O immortal city of the Rhone, lift but for one
moment the veil that hides from us those tremendous
secrets which fill the air with dreams and presences even
to this hour!"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the appeal was not altogether in vain, for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
few isolated facts began to drift, ghost-like, into view.
They were images imprinted in childish days while
Avignon was nothing but a name, and so the ill-guided
imagination had placed the city on the plain; a bare, arid
group of houses surrounding a vague, vast structure,
against which clouds of dust were continually being
driven.
</p>

<p>
It was curious and interesting to compare this long-cherished
picture with the reality. In connection with
it was another painted in richer tones. The subject was
the journey of Philip of Valois through his kingdom with
the kings of Navarre and Bohemia in his train. After
passing through Burgundy&mdash;broad and spacious Burgundy,
with its straggling, brown villages&mdash;he arrives
here at Avignon, where other kings have hurried to
meet him, and is magnificently received by the Pope.
Which of the seven Popes was it? Alas! memory
failed, but King Philip was lodged over there across
the river at Villeneuve-les-Avignon.
</p>

<p>
"Beyond the island where the huge castle is on the
hill?" Barbara inquired. "What a shabby sort of place
to put a king."
</p>

<p>
My idea, too, of Villeneuve, till I saw it, had been a
brilliant little pleasure-city, full of splendid cardinals'
palaces.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go and see the town," said Barbara; "perhaps
the palaces are still there."
</p>

<p>
We decided to go that very day. A place is twice
seen that is seen at once. Some discerning person
had read me Froissart's account of the scene, and I had
never forgotten it; the feastings and festivals that burst
forth all over the city, till Lent came; and then the
thrilling news that went flying through the country that
the Saracens were marching against the Holy Land.
This was a threat to all Christendom. It was difficult to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
imagine what it must have been to fear a possible invasion
of those terrible enemies.
</p>

<p>
But the city was spared. The Pope preached a great
sermon to his congregation of kings, exhorting them
to take the cross. They all obeyed. And then the
visionary pictures became a procession: the King of
France with his retinue journeying westward into
Languedoc&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Languedoc?" questioned Barbara.
</p>

<p>
It was just before us across the Rhone; lovely brown
hills on the horizon.
</p>

<p>
And so the royal company moved in picturesque progress
through the provinces of France: Auvergne, Berry,
Beauce, and so on, till they reached Paris.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to have seen it," said Barbara. "I
wonder if they wore long robes and ermine."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not quite so beautiful a garb as that, but,
thank Heaven, we know they didn't wear tweed suits!
When the human race took to doing that they bid
goodbye to the charm and romance of life for ever."
</p>

<p>
"But I think men look quite nice in tweed suits," said
Barbara. "I am sure they would look ridiculous now in
mantles and ermine."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's another matter. There is always something
a little ridiculous about civilised man, 'rough hew
him how you may'; but nothing brings it out so fatally
as tweed."
</p>

<p>
Barbara remonstrated, and then wanted to know if I
could remember any more.
</p>

<p>
I could remember nothing about Avignon, but between
us we recollected incidents about the beginning of the
Hundred Years' War, which took place just at this time.
It was a luckless day for France and England when
Edward III. was so ill-inspired as to assert his roundabout
claim to the throne of France! The fair country
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
became the scene of raids and sieges, ravaging of
provinces, taking and retaking of towns and castles,
battle and murder and sudden death.
</p>

<p>
Of this there are of course endless chronicles; of all
the moil and toil of war and rapine, of the clash of rival
interests, of mad ambitions which, once gratified, left
their victims only more wild and craving than before.
</p>

<p>
If the annals of the Middle Ages have a moral it is
this: Fling away ambition. Fling away this crude
passion of kings and captains which seems to drive a
man like a fury through his untasted life, never giving
him pause to possess what he has won or even to realise
the triumph of his achievement.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me more," demanded Barbara.
</p>

<p>
But the pictures were at an end. Quite capriciously it
seemed, certain scenes had painted themselves on the
mind, but what followed chronologically had made no
special impression, perhaps because there was a general
confusion of wars and tumults, till suddenly we emerge
on familiar ground at the battles of Creçy and Poitiers.
</p>

<p>
We had grown tired of trying to realise the things of
the past, and strolled down to the river, to the long
suspension bridge, where, as every French child knows,
"on y danse, on y danse." And here one has a fine view
of Villeneuve, across the Rhone, and looking back,
of Avignon. From this point its walls are strikingly
picturesque, ramparts of the fourteenth century, built
by Clement VI. and described by a modern author as a
"remarkably beautiful specimen of mediæval masonry,
with a battlemented wall for projecting machicolations
on finely moulded corbels"&mdash;corbels of four or five
courses, which give an appearance almost Eastern to
these splendid walls and gateways.
</p>

<p>
"The intensest life of the fourteenth century," says
the same writer, "passed through the Gothic portal over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
which the portcullis hung in its chamber ever ready to
drop with a thundering crash, and fix its iron teeth in
the ground."
</p>

<p>
Barbara asked a great many searching questions about
times and manners. But here I began to experience
what some discriminating person has called a "reaction
against the despotism of facts." I did not know any
more. I began to repent of having excited this inordinate
thirst for information. However, very little is needed to
enable one to achieve a general impression of France in
the fourteenth century. One has merely to think of the
fair land under the horrors of sack and siege, burning
towns, starving people, all the agonies of chronic warfare.
What is more difficult is to descend from the general to
the particular, and to imagine what sort of life that must
have been for the mortal who was neither a King nor a
Pope, nor a plundering freebooter, but only a human
being with a life to ruin and a heart to break.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Even while one is dreaming of other things, that
wonderful Palace is impressing itself upon the sentiment
with steady power. It stands there in the blaze of light,
tremendous, inevitable, like a fact of nature. One can
scarcely think it away. It resists even that mighty force,
the human imagination.
</p>

<p>
Avignon! the Roman <i>Avenio</i>; a place of many events,
many influences, which have helped to make our present
life what it is&mdash;we are really there, absurdly improbable as
it seems; we, with our modern minds, modern speech,
modern preconceptions, in the bright land of the
troubadours; and, stranger still, in the land where the
Phœnicians traded, the Greeks colonised, the Romans
built their inevitable baths and amphitheatres; where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
the ancient Ligurians lived their lives on peaked hilltops,
and race fought race and tribe fought tribe, when
there was neither Pope in Avignon nor King in France,
but only wild gods and wilder chieftains ruling in the
lawless, beautiful land.
</p>

<p>
From the height of the Rocher du Dom (we climb
there at last by the zig-zag pine-shadowed road) the
whole country bursts upon us, blue, wide, mountain-encircled,
radiant; with the Rhone winding across the
plain, dreaming of mysterious things. The great river
has a personality of its own as strong as that of the
palace. It sweeps to the foot of our cliff and takes a
splendid curve round the south side of the town, past the
ruined bridge of St. Benézet, with its romantic chapel
poised midway above the rush and flurry of the river.
</p>

<p>
Every year, on Christmas Eve, Mass used to be celebrated
in this little chapel of the Rhone, and strange
must it have been when the yellow lights glowed&mdash;just
once of all the nights of the long year&mdash;on its lonely altar,
and the chanting of priests rose and fell above the sound
of the marauding waters. But for their aggressions, the
grand old bridge would still be carrying passengers from
the Papal city across the two branches of the river and
the island of St. Barthelasse to the foot of the tower of
Philippe le Bel.
</p>

<p>
This old tower is, perhaps, the most striking building&mdash;except
the great castle&mdash;in the decaying town of
Villeneuve where the Cardinals built so many palaces.
Here it was, in that forgotten little haunt of pleasure,
that the guests of the Pope were once so gloriously
lodged and entertained. And now&mdash;sad beyond all telling
is the little town! Ardouin-Dumazet, the author of
"Un Voyage en France," seems to have been impressed
by its forlornness as much as we were, for he writes of
it in words that evoke the very spirit of the place:&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Amas de toits audessus desquels surgissent des eglises
rongées par le temps, des edifices à physiognomie triste
et vague&mdash;La ville est d'apparence morne. Elle dut
être splendide jadis: de grands hotels, des maisons de
noble ordonnance, des voies bordées d'arcades indiquent
un passé prosperé. Les moindres détails: ferrurues de
portes et de balcon, corbeaux, statuettes d'angle sont
d'un art tres pur. Aujourd'hui on rencontre surtout des
chiens et des chats&mdash;On pourrait se croire dans une ville
morte&mdash;On va errer par les lamentables et pittoresques
débris de la Chartreuse du Val-de-Bénédiction où sont
encore de merveilles architecturales."
</p>

<p>
Everywhere, indeed, as one wanders, one comes upon
these "architectural marvels." A fine doorway giving
entrance to a wheelwright's yard; delicate pieces of
iron-work on the balcony of a barber's shop; a scrap of
stone carving; a noble block of buildings in some ill-kept
street.
</p>

<p>
The symphonic beauty of such relics of the Renaissance
which are found in almost every town of the South of
France, bears in upon the imagination the truth of the
saying of the great architect Alberti that a slight alteration
in the curves of his design for San Francesco at
Rimini would "spoil his music."
</p>

<p>
The traveller who climbs the hill to the vast fortress
of St. André&mdash;with its battlements of the fourteenth
century&mdash;enters a scene even more eloquent of desolation.
But splendid it must have been in the days of its
glory!

<p>
The huge drum towers of the entrance gate recall old
dreams of romantic adventure. But for the strange
silence of the place, it might almost excite expectations
of clattering cavalcades, and one knows not what medley
of bright figures in harmony with the mediæval background.
But the silence broods on, unbroken. A black
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
kitten is the only living thing that meets the view as we
pass through the shadows of the gateway. A dishevelled
grey village has grown up within the walls, its steep
street climbing upward to the summit of the hill, while
a cypress-guarded convent stands within its own high
walls. Here the sisters pass their lives, doubly immured.
If some unhappy nun tried to escape, she would not only
have to penetrate the stern boundaries of her retreat, but
to scale the ramparts of the fortress into the bargain; the
engines of State and Religion arrayed against her; of this
world and the next. It prompted one to carry the significant
symbol further afield, and to follow in imagination
the fortunes not only of the fugitive nun but of the
escaping woman!
</p>

<p>
As we begin the ascent of the desolate street, the black
kitten slips coquettishly across the way, at a slant, her
tail high in the air, like a ruler, as the School-Board
essayist happily puts it. We hail her as alluringly as
may be, but she is away beyond our reach up a little outside
staircase leading to the doorway of one of the few
habitable houses. From this eminence she looks down
upon us mockingly, clearly enjoying our disadvantage.
This piques us and we engage in pursuit. The imp
finally vanishes into the doorway, and presently a
miserably clad, dejected-looking woman emerges. Evidently
the kitten had announced to her the advent of
visitors. She leads the way, a huge bunch of keys in her
hand, the kitten following in a self-willed, flighty sort of
fashion. While we are trifling with ancient walls and
gruesome dungeons, the kitten is busy catching phantom
mice among the heaps of fallen masonry that encumber
the grassy hill-top, forlorn remains, indeed, of human
habitations.

</div>

<p>
The little chapel of the convent strikes with a chill as
we enter&mdash;surely it is something more than a chill; a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
sense of something deathly. In a flash comes the horrified
sense of the death-in-life that is hidden behind these
mysterious walls. One needs no detail, no assurance;
the whole beats in upon the consciousness, steals in like
an atmosphere, as we stand in the shadow looking at the
little flower-decked altar, musty and tawdry with its
artificial flowers and flounced draperies.
</p>

<p>
"Of what Order are the Sisters?" we inquire, in
undertones, after a long silence.
</p>

<p>
"Sh&mdash;h," warns a reproving voice from a hidden part
of the chapel, which had been so arranged as to leave
the west-end of it invisible to all but the inmates of the
convent.
</p>

<p>
"C'est une des soeurs," whispered our guide, and we
turned and left the devotee to her prayers.
</p>

<p>
A truly amazing thing the human spirit! There are
times when one feels entirely divorced from it, as if one
were studying its manifestations from the point of view
of an alien race. And there is no epoch so baffling to
the modern mind as the mediæval. The ancients seem
normal, straight-going, and eminently human as compared
with the men and women of the Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>
We are taken to the dungeons in the entrance towers
where our feudal forefathers inflicted one dares not think
what agonies, and without a pang of remorse; rather
with a sense of right and heaven-inspired justice. It was
within the walls of this fortress, probably in a cell of the
Convent, that the Man in the Iron Mask passed the
dreadful days and nights of his life.
</p>

<p>
The sentiment of the unimaginative ruffian who could
condemn a fellow-creature to this living grave is probably
beyond the understanding of a modern&mdash;short of a criminal
lunatic. We are glad to hurry out again into the light,
oppressed by the shadow of misery and wickedness that
seems to hang about the place to this hour.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There are many who hold that the world has made no
real progress except in material civilisation. That is a
subject that might best be studied in some mouldering
dungeon, which, be it remembered, was just as much a
"necessary part" of the mediæval castle as the kitchen
or pantry is of its descendant, the country-house of
to-day.
</p>

<p>
If such strongholds were either let or sold in the feudal
era, they were doubtless recommended to intending purchasers
as having well-appointed torture-chambers, fitted
with all the latest improvements in racks and thumb-screws.
Without venturing to claim too much for the
average modern, he may be said to have advanced a little
beyond the stage when the thumb-screw was an instrument
that no gentleman's house should be without. As the
change of ideals to which this improvement is due may
be said to have taken place in Provence, fostered and
impelled, paradox as it seems, within the precincts of the
feudal castle itself with its chains and oubliettes, those
sighing ruins become strangely moving and significant.
</p>

<p>
Our poor, half-starved guide, however, looks as if she
thought them anything but significant as she leads us up
and down the fallen masonry, the kitten following always,
and often springing to her shoulders and curving its lithe
little body round her neck.
</p>

<p>
"Il est comme notre enfant," she says, half apologetically.
"Nous n'en avons pas, des enfants." And the
kitten swirls its tail in her face as if to assure her that
it could well fill the place of any number of children.
The faithful little acolyte had to be left outside the door
leading to the dungeons, for she used to get lost in the
passages and the turret staircase. But there she waited,
mewing at intervals, till we re-emerged, and then she
sprang with a little purring cry on to her mistress's
shoulder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We were at the entrance gate, and the round of the
fortress was finished. We bade goodbye to the woman,
who pocketed her "tip" and hastened back with her
attendant sprite to the little grey, half-ruined house where
she passes her grey, unimaginable life!

CHAPTER III
</p>

<p class="center">A SEVERE CRITIC&mdash;UZÈS AND BARBENTANE
</p>

<p>
At the <i>table d'hôte</i> of our hotel, a little group of
travellers was clustered at the far end of the long,
old-fashioned room&mdash;silent, French though they were.
My neighbour was a pale, faintly-outlined young man,
with short, colourless hair. Curious that so artistic a
nation should crop its hair so very close, I idly mused.
That pallor? Presumably the lack of outdoor exercise,
not to enter upon dark possibilities of absinthe and other
Parisian roads to ruin.
</p>

<p>
At about the stage of the <i>entrée</i> the subject of these
conjectures, bracing himself to the task, turned and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Est ce que vous êtes depuis longtemps à Avignon,
madame?" (Accent a little provincial, I thought, perhaps
Provençal, which was interesting!)
</p>

<p>
"Non, monsieur, je ne suis ici que depuis hier," I
responded, not only in my best French, but with as
much sociability as I could throw into the somewhat
arid reply, for I desired to prolong a conversation that
might throw light upon the fascinating country.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said the close-cropped one, with a gesture that
I thought Gallic, "je suis un peu&mdash;de&mdash;dis&mdash;disappointed,
as we say in English," he suddenly broke up, with an
exasperated abandonment of the foreign lingo. The man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
was an Englishman, for all he was worth! Barbara
laughed aloud, getting wind of the situation. So much
for the distinctions of national types. My neighbour
had made precisely the same mistake on his side that I
had made on mine.
</p>

<p>
With Avignon he was indeed "a little disappointed."
He thought the Palace bare and ugly, and the town dirty
and unattractive. The view from the Rocher du Dom?
Yes, that was rather fine. Give the devil his due, he
evidently felt. What was the height of Mont Ventoux?
I longed to rush wildly into figures, but principle restrained
me. Did I mean to go to Chateauneuf? Our friend had
been there. Tumble-down old place. One could see it
from the Rocher du Dom across the river. They made
rather good wine there.
</p>

<p>
Chateauneuf! Good wine there!
</p>

<p>
Was this the famous Chateauneuf, the ancient country
seat of the Popes, the lordly pleasure-house of the most
luxurious and brilliant Court of the Middle Ages?&mdash;("Not
much luxury about it now!" said our tourist)&mdash;a
vast Summer Palace situated on one of the finest sites
of the district, whence one could see Vaucluse itself in
the Vale of the Sorgue, Petrarch's beloved retreat from
the clamour of the Papal City; and Vacqueiras, the
home of Raimbaut de Vacqueiras, the celebrated troubadour,
and many another spot of greater or less renown.
</p>

<p>
Here, too, a modern singer had been born: Anselm
Mathieu, and in the old house of his family the
Provençal Félibres used to meet, reciting verses, singing
songs, and doubtless pledging one another in the famous
vintage of Chateauneuf, the "rather good wine" of our
severe critic.
</p>

<p>
He placidly continued his crushing observations.
Vaucluse he considered a much over-rated spot, though
the cliffs and crags above the source of the river <i>were</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
rather striking. Was there anything more to see in
Avignon after one had done the Palace and the Museum?
I reluctantly admitted there was but little one could
recommend to a critical spirit. Our level-headed tourist
had spent an hour in Villeneuve that morning&mdash;the little
town across the bridge with the big castle, he explained&mdash;and
found it depressing&mdash;everything peeling off. The
description was annoyingly apt. There was no gainsaying
it. Only it was not exhaustive.
</p>

<p>
Its author intended to go next morning to see the
Pont du Gard, about which one heard so many laudatory
accounts. He was told that he wouldn't think as much
of it as he expected. How much he expected after this
warning I was unable to estimate, but I thought it safe
to prophesy disappointment. He said himself that he
confidently anticipated it. I wondered vaguely whether
the condition of mind thus described was capable of
analysis, but did not attempt it. I felt Barbara was
emotionally in a state of unstable equilibrium, and dared
not add to her provocations. My neighbour further
complained that considering the general importance of
Avignon and one's extreme familiarity with its name,
historically speaking, it seemed surprisingly shabby and
small&mdash;narrow streets and all that. We admitted the
narrow streets.
</p>

<p>
And there wasn't a decent church in the whole place!
Wouldn't compare with Bruges or Rouen. My tourist
was at Rouen in the autumn of '98, and at Bruges in
September of '99, on a cycling tour&mdash;or was it August?
</p>

<p>
I thought it might be August.
</p>

<p>
Yes (our friend's memory clarified most satisfactorily),
it was the last week in August. On the 18th he had left
London. I knew that hot weather we had all over
England and the Continent at the end of August in
that year?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I evidently must have known it, so it seemed scarcely
worth while confessing that my memory failed to distinguish
the particular heat of that summer from the more
or less similar oppressiveness of any other season.
</p>

<p>
Well, he and two fellows cycled all through Holland
and Belgium in ten days and three hours; saw everything.
They made an average of sixty miles a day.
Barbara, who hailed from north of the Tweed, said
"Aw!" and the flattered cyclist hastened to add, with
becoming modesty, that of course the roads were good
and the country flat. They did ninety several days.
Pretty fair with the thermometer at 70° in the shade&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"An interesting country for such a tour?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather flat; never get a really good spin; though
on the other hand, there is no uphill work."
</p>

<p>
For general interest did the country compare at all
with Provence? I wanted to turn my informant from
his line of ideas just for the fun of seeing him work back
to it, as an intercepted ant or earwig will pursue its
chosen path, no matter how many obstacles one may
throw in the way. Our tourist doubled and fell into line
again almost at once.
</p>

<p>
Provence? He had been recommended to give it a
trial, but so far had seen nothing particular to attract
one. Too hot for cycling, and hotels very poor. And,
as he said before, there were no churches, let alone
cathedrals. Look at the cathedral here, as they had the
cheek to call it, perched up on a rock like a Swiss
châlet. And what architecture! Baedecker called it
Romanesque. He always called things Romanesque
when there was nothing else he <i>could</i> decently call
them. (This was cheering; a sort of inverted enthusiasm
which at least was less depressing than
indifference.) Why couldn't they stick to some definite
style&mdash;Gothic or something? However, he (my neighbour)
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
didn't pretend to know anything about these
matters, though he evidently felt that the architects
who couldn't bring themselves to settle down decisively
into "Gothic or something" had made rather a poor
thing of their profession. It seemed to him that there
was a baldness about the buildings here. They <i>might</i> be
all right, but so they struck him. Rienzi's tower, for
instance&mdash;not a rag of ornament!
</p>

<p>
I had begun to suggest an unsatisfied yearning for a
few minarets with a trifle of Early Perpendicular work
down the sides, when I became aware that for various
reasons&mdash;Barbara especially&mdash;it was wiser to desist.
</p>

<p>
It was not till our friend had gone next day to court
disappointment at the Pont du Gard that we felt the
lifting of the curious, leaden atmosphere that he had
thrown around him. His presence seemed to stop the
heart-beat of the place, nay, one's own heart-beat, till
nothing was left but hotels and averages and heights and
dates. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> And some day somebody would have
to travel with such a being&mdash;perhaps for life. Heaven
help the other traveller!
</p>

<p>
However, after all, it was possibly wholesome to have
one's hot-headed impressions subjected to the cold
light of an Englishman's reason. Our compatriot,
with his severely rational way of conducting himself,
had doubtless gathered a crop of solid information, which
was more than could be said for <i>our</i> methods. I told
Barbara that I was going to regard Avignon henceforth
from the point of view of its population and height above
the sea, and I hunted up facts in guide-books and put her
in possession of all available dates from the earliest ages
to the present day. She did not seem to me to
assimilate them satisfactorily.
</p>

<p class="caption">RIENZI'S TOWER, AVIGNON.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The country round Avignon serves to remind one of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
the fact that it was, in ancient times, a good deal nearer
the sea than it is at present. The outlines are like
those of a sea-bordering country; such heights as there
are have the character of cliffs, or they are level-topped,
smoothed-out hills until one reaches the grotesque
escarpments of the Alpilles or the wild masses of the
Luberon range, once island summits rising from the
waters.
</p>

<p>
Avignon stands majestically on one of these heights,
with the Rhone valley spreading wide on every hand.
</p>

<p>
It looks like a magic city in the sunshine or in the
glow of evening; the interminable Palace, the Cathedral,
the spires and towers rising against the sky with that
particular serenity of beauty that we think of as belonging
to the land of dreams.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A railway journey of about two hours from Avignon
takes one to the little ducal city of Uzès, which lies in
the heart of this curious lateral country, whose eminences
have no peaks or highest points, whose lines are all
horizontal.
</p>

<p>
Upon the sky-line at the end of the leisurely journey
appears a striking mass of buildings and mediæval towers,
announcing to the lover of architecture that some delightful
hours are before him.
</p>

<p>
A quaint old omnibus takes (and shakes) the passengers&mdash;mostly
commercial travellers&mdash;up the slight hill and
in through the grey gates of this stately little city, landing
one and all at the big inn in the broad main street.
Except that it is so exceedingly quiet, it has something
in common with the street of an English
cathedral town.
</p>

<p>
Obviously Uzès has been a place of importance in the
past: the public buildings are on a grand scale and of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
fine design; the Ducal Palace announces the capital of a
little Principality or Duchy, and the number of churches
would suggest either a large population or a very devout
one. But a sort of trance seems to have fallen upon the
place, and not even the bustle of the inn at its busiest
moments, when the vast, dark-papered dining-room is
filled with hungry passengers, can overcome the sense of
suspended life that haunts the town.
</p>

<p>
But in the earlier centuries it had a stirring history.
Uzès possessed some valiant seigneurs in the days of
Philippe le Bel, for that monarch was so pleased with
their prowess that he erected the town into a "Vicomté."
It was governed by its seigneurs and its bishops who
shared the jurisdiction, and a lively time they must
have had of it!
</p>

<p>
It has always been a fiery little city, and during the
religious wars of the sixteenth century was the scene of
terrible struggles and massacres, even in the very churches,
which were half ruined during this period. Perhaps the
tumult of those times has left Uzès weary and sad, for
now the place seems dedicated to the God of Sleep.
</p>

<p>
The shaded promenade or terrace, with its white
parapet of short stone pillars, runs round two sides of
the Ducal Garden outside its walls&mdash;a delightful spot
to rest or loiter in, commanding a curious wide view
over the country, which is, however, suddenly shut in by
a hard, high horizon line as level as if it were ruled, or as
if it were the edge of a plain, though it is really a range
of hills.
</p>

<p>
The trees of the shady old garden of the Duché drop
their branches over a high wall; at the back of the
demesne the Cathedral stands half hidden by some of
the buildings of the Duché and beside it rises one of the
most singular and beautiful architectural monuments of
the South, La Tour Fenestrella, an exquisite Romanesque

tower, much smaller but more graceful than the Leaning
Tower of Pisa, which it otherwise resembles.
</p>

<p>
It springs upwards, tier after tier of little arches,
with an effect of exquisite lightness and strength,
and leaves one wondering why this delicate example of
Romanesque work does not enjoy a greater renown.
</p>

<p>
Many hours might be well spent in this forgotten
little city, where in the old days the intense quiet that
broods over it&mdash;as if invading it from the strange, almost
ominous landscape beyond the parapet&mdash;was broken by
the din of warfare more violent and more unappeasable
than any other sort of strife: that of religion.

In early spring the plain of the Rhone in the neighbourhood
of Avignon is all flushed with young almond
blossoms. The carriage of the tourist trundles past field
after field of misty pink, and for the time he might fancy
himself in the landscape of a Japanese fan.
</p>

<p>
Above this plain, perched on a bare hillside that gives
a bird's-eye view of the wide expanse of the Rhone
valley, stands the ancient village of Barbentane, a name
that occurs constantly in the literature of Provence,
especially in the poems of Mistral. In Roman days
Barbentane or Bellinto, a station on the road between
Tarascon and Orange, was an island surrounded by the
waters of the Durance.

It is of far less imposing aspect than Uzès and is
approached by a long, ascending road, which is continuous
with the broad main street of the town,

downs, stands the tall ruined tower of Barbentane,
which has a romantic story attached to it. Mistral
writes of it:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The Bishop of Avignon ...</p>
<p class="i2">Has built a tower at Barbentane,</p>
<p class="i2">Sea-wind it spurns, and tramontane,</p>
<p class="i2">And round it demons rage in vain.</p>
<p class="i4">He'll exorcise</p>
<p class="i4">The walls that rise</p>
<p class="i4">With turrets square</p>
<p class="i4">From rocks so bare.</p>
<p class="i2">Its front looks to the setting sun,</p>
<p class="i2">And over the windows one by one&mdash;</p>

<p class="i2">He carves his mitre over the glass."<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a></p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
To this demon-proof stronghold the Bishop appoints
a warder, who&mdash;as is the way of warders&mdash;has a
charming daughter, Mourrette. Mourrette has a lover
who is determined to scale the walls of the fortress and
carry off the damsel or die in the attempt. Unfortunately,
he dies in the attempt.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div></div>

<p>
Tragedy as usual! If all had gone well, the story in
all likelihood would never have reached us. We may,
perhaps, conclude that life is not quite so dark as history
and literature might lead us to believe.

<p class="p2">
The author of "Un voyage en France" writes:&mdash;
</p>

valley.

<p>
On the opposite side of it stands an ancient but still
inhabited castle belonging to the Comte des Essars (or
some similar name), situated upon a sudden height
or cliff and approached by a steep and shady avenue
which leads to a modern garden of evergreen shrubs,
all very carefully grouped and tended. At the highest
point appears the great square castle, with its round
tower at each corner, and crenellated walls.
</p>

<p>
The caretaker admits the visitor to a large courtyard
and thence to the suites of sombre old rooms with their
dark ceilings, stately mantelpieces and rich, ancient
furniture, all spell-bound as if waiting for the life that
has gone away. The owners only come there for about
a month in the time of the grape-harvest, but the
evidence of their presence in little personal belongings,
such as racks full of pipes, carved sticks, riding whips,
photographs, and so forth, emphasises pathetically the
silence of the house, which is speckless and in perfect
order, ready at any moment for habitation.
</p>

<p>
The place is well worth a visit, not merely for its rather
sad charm, but because it helps the imagination to reconstruct
the life and aspect of the feudal castle; for such
edifices as this are generally seen in ruins, emptied of all
their splendours. Here rises before one's eye the scene
of mediæval romance almost precisely as in the days of
the troubadours and their fascinating ladies.
</p>

<p>
It seemed a pity that our friend the critic had left
Avignon without having seen this place where the little
touches of the modern (especially that prosaic garden of
well-groomed evergreens) would have cheered his soul
and proved to him that Provence could, after all, produce
something that was not either tumble-down or peeling off.
</p>

<p>
Such is the contradictoriness of human nature, that we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
began to regard with regret the certainty that he would
not be at the <i>table d'hôte</i> that night to record his disappointments.
It was quite interesting to watch the
process by which he would throw an atmosphere of
spiritual deathliness&mdash;a sort of moral incandescent gaslight&mdash;over
the fascinating things of this despised
country.
</p>

<p>
We realised that, in spite of his powers of disenchantment,
we had found a sort of satisfaction (like the
satisfaction of a discord in music) in the bleakness of
our friend's outlook upon life and things.
</p>

<p>
It made one, perhaps not very relevantly, think of
Madame de Sévigné's phrase:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Toujours soutenue de l'ignorance capable de Madame
de B&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ignorance capable!" We positively missed it!

CHAPTER IV
</p>

<p class="center">PETRARCH AND LAURA
</p>

<p>
How well one understands why it is that the South has
produced so much art and so little philosophy! We
found ourselves spending hours basking in this delicious
sun, while we idly wondered how often the beautiful
Laura crossed the square, exactly how she looked, and
spoke, and smiled; above all, how she felt: the real
truth about that mysterious romance. The customs
of the day, the universal habit of love-making as part
of the necessary accomplishments of a gentleman, make
it difficult to recognise the genuine love-story when one
finds it.
</p>

<p>
Barbara was much interested in these immortal lovers,
much more so than in Rienzi's tower or old churches;
and we managed to glean a good deal of desultory
information on the subject, which brought us to the
conclusion that Laura was a real person and Petrarch's
a real passion. The fact that in his prose writings he
scarcely ever alludes to his beloved one seemed to us
to support our views. He did not care to talk to all the
world of what he felt so deeply. Sonnets were more
impersonal. In his favourite copy of Virgil he records
his first meeting with Laura, and her death twenty-one
years later. Barbara considered this conclusive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Laura, who was distinguished by her own virtues and
widely celebrated by my songs, first appeared to my eyes
in early manhood in the year of our Lord 1327, upon the
sixth day of April, at the first hour in the Church of
St. Clara at Avignon." In the same minute way he
records her death while he was at Verona, "ignorant of
his fate."
</p>

<p>
"I have experienced," he adds, "a certain satisfaction
in writing this bitter record of a cruel event, especially
in this place where it will often come under my eyes, for
so I may be led to reflect that life can afford me no
farther pleasures."
</p>

<p>
He appears all through his career to have been struggling
between his love for this unattainable lady and the
monastic view of life as inculcated by St. Augustine. No
wonder his was a tempest-tossed and melancholy soul!
Among his published works the imaginary dialogue
between himself and the saint lays bare the curious
combat of a nature essentially modern in its instincts,
while intellectually under the dominion of mediæval
theories. His sentiment was noble in character: a
noble love for a noble woman; but the pitiless saint
will not accept that as an excuse for the soul's enslavement.
The monitor does his utmost to prove that it is a
chain utterly unworthy of a rational being, whose thoughts
should be fixed on things eternal. It does not occur
to Petrarch to make high claim for the sentiment itself,
still less to number it among eternal things, as probably
it would have occurred to a mind of that idealistic type
had he lived a few hundred years later. But his feeling
and his mental outlook are evidently not at one. He
feels ahead of his thought by many centuries, and never
all his life does he succeed in harmonising the two parts
of his being, and that is probably why he was always
unsatisfied, sad at heart even at his gayest; unable to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
fully enjoy the savour of life in spite of his extraordinary
fulness of opportunity and his ardent nature.
</p>

<p class="caption">VALE AND SOURCE OF THE SORGUE, VAUCLUSE.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
As for the theory that Laura was merely a symbol for
<i>Laurea</i>, the crown of poetic fame, it is not easy to accept
the view in face of a letter of Petrarch to his friend,
Giacomo Colonna, in which he speaks of this supposition:
"Would that your humorous suggestion were true;
would to God it were all a pretence and not a madness!"
</p>

<p>
His defence of this passion, in the "Segreto," is described
by a writer of to-day as "purely modern."
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Petrarch was modern enough to grasp, and even defend against
the perversions of monasticism and the current of theological
speculation, one of the noblest of man's attributes."
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the singular dialogue between the poet and the
saint, the poet, while making a brave stand for the
unconquerable sentiment, finally allows the saint to have
the best of the argument.
</p>

<p>
Barbara flatly refused to listen to the theory that
Petrarch and Laura never exchanged so much as a word
in their lives, but it is believed by many. The poet is
said to have worshipped the lady at a distance across
the golden shadows of the Church of St. Clara at
Avignon, where she used to come for the celebration
of Mass. Her family&mdash;if to the family of de Noves she
really belonged&mdash;owned a château in the neighbourhood.
She married into the house of De Sades (or so runs the
story) and she was a niece of the famous Fanette, who
was President of the renowned Court of Love at the
Château of Romanin in the Alpilles: those strange little
limestone mountains that we saw to the south as we
looked over the country from the Rocher du Dom.
</p>

<p>
Some writers, on the other hand, speak of a passionate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
history, clandestine meetings, tragedy and despair. But
of this there is not a hint in the poet's own writings.
Nothing certain seems to be known about the matter,
and it is even regarded as entirely fabulous by some
sceptics who would banish from history all its charming
stories, the mere fact of a romantic flavour seeming to
them to prove a legend untrue. As if real life were
constructed on such dull and unimaginative lines!
</p>

<p>
If, however, the story of Petrarch and Laura be well
founded, he must have been the very prince of lovers, for
his love was well-nigh untiring, although seemingly
hopeless, uncheered by even an occasional meeting; and
it remained in his heart obstinately and irrevocably, in
spite of the most persistent efforts of his intellect and his
religious sense to oust it; in spite of a life among the
Courts of Europe the most brilliant and varied that can
be imagined.
</p>

<p>
Petrarch possessed also the genius of friendship, and
had swarms of friends. When Pope Clement VI., one of
the number, lay dying in his fortress palace, the poet
sent a message: "Remember the epitaph of the Roman
Emperor Hadrian: 'Turba Medicorum Perii.'" And he
wrote a letter to the Pope in the same strain: "What
makes me really tremble is to see your bed surrounded
with physicians who never agree."...
</p>

<p>
One likes to picture him in these old halls and to know
that he possessed the genial faculty of making people
feel the happier for his presence. Yet it is recorded that
"deep remorse and profound melancholy afflicted the
poet's soul."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps his hopeless love may have clouded his spirit,
for this does happen in exceptional natures; or is it
that, in truth, there are untold agonies, late or soon,
in the hearts of all who have the power to move and to
delight?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Certain it is that Petrarch possessed an immense
attraction for almost every type of mind and character.
He must indeed have been a man of infinite charm. He
was the friend of kings, scholars, Popes, princes, soldiers,
statesmen. He ardently championed the cause of Rienzi,
and of the Emperor Charles IV.; for the idea of keeping
up the succession of the Holy Roman Empire appealed
powerfully to his imagination, and when that monarch
gave up his campaign before he had made good his
imperial claims on Italy, Petrarch wrote bitterly reproaching
him for abandoning so sacred a heritage.
</p>

<p>
In Avignon, among hosts of devoted friends, were the
Princes of the House of Colonna; and the friendship
was not destroyed even when Petrarch sided warmly
with Rienzi against the turbulent nobles of Rome, among
whom the Colonna were pre-eminent.
</p>

<p>
But in spite of his popularity in the Papal city,
Petrarch heartily detested this Gallic Babylon, as he
called it, and loved to retire from its splendours to
Vaucluse, not far off, where he tried to regain serenity in
the silence of that strangely romantic spot. A sad-looking
little house is still pointed out as the home of
the poet; with a shady, wild garden running down to
the waters of the Sorgue as they rush foaming from the
narrow vale, whose stupendous cliffs are as gloomy and
hope-destroying as St. Augustine himself!&mdash;St. Augustine
as represented in the "Segreto" at any rate.
</p>

<p>
Here, in his beloved retreat, the poet seems to have
perpetually tormented himself with reflections about the
vanity of life and the folly of human affections, as if the
stern figure of his monitor were indeed still shadowing
his spirit. But the saint, for all his arguments, cannot
conquer the poet's nature, or free him from what he
calls the adamantine chains that bind him to Love and
Fame.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"These charm while they destroy," he makes the saint
declare.
</p>

<p>
"What have I done to you?" Petrarch exclaims,
"that you should deprive me of my most splendid preoccupations
and condemn to eternal darkness the
brightest part of my soul?"
</p>

<p>
It is in the grip of his splendid preoccupations that one
sees him oftenest.
</p>

<p>
Petrarch's parents were forced to leave Florence,
where his father was a notary, by the same revolution
that exiled Dante, and after some wanderings they fixed
themselves at Avignon, sending the poet to study jurisprudence
at Montpellier, close at hand. It was on his
return to the Papal city, after the death of his parents,
that he saw Laura for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Judging by the sonnets, he met her fairly often afterwards
in Avignon, but never with any hope of a return
for his passion.
</p>

<p>
A glance, a word of greeting at most, were all his
reward, but out of these he appears to have woven a sort
of painful joy. His was an unquiet spirit. One feels
it as almost a relief to read of his death and of his
peaceful tomb at Arqua in the Euganæan hills above
a clear and beautiful river. "It stands on the little
square before the church where the peasants congregate
at Mass-time&mdash;open to the skies, girdled by the hills and
within hearing of the vocal stream."
</p>

<p>
It is a pathetic picture that is left in the mind at the
last, as the poet writes from the sweet solitude of his
garden at Parma, whither he had retired towards the end
of his days, drawn, doubtless, to his native land, for which
he had always a profound attachment.
</p>

<p>
"I pass my life in the church or in my garden," he
says. The words are so simple and quiet, and yet they
are infinitely pathetic. When one remembers what a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
centre of emotion and longing and sorrow the human
heart must be from its very nature, and what a stormy,
ambitious, loving and suffering spirit Petrarch's had
always been, the quietness of those words and the
picture they call up is more touching and significant
than a hundred homilies. One knows a little now what
sort of thoughts used to pass through the poet's mind, as
he bent his steps towards the great painted chambers
where his entry brought to all quick nerves a touch of
sunshine and a wave of harmony.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Barbara gave a little laugh as we ascended the
broad whitewashed staircase, once rich with colour,
that led to the endless galleries of this leviathan of a
palace.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what our friend would say to this!" she
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Not a rag of ornament," I quoted sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Not Gothic or anything," Barbara complained.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," I warned, as we entered a vast room
with a vaulted ceiling, which revealed by one small
corner of the huge expanse the magnificent canopy of
rich frescoes that had once overhung the assemblies of
the Popes. "If it is not Gothic, at least it's&mdash;<i>any</i>thing!"
I cried, with enthusiasm. And truly anything and everything
that is sumptuous, mellow, exquisite in wealth and
modulation of colour this great hall, with its painted
vaultings, must have been. But the splendour had been
desecrated by some Vandal, careless of his country's
pride. Instead of leaving the great audience chamber to
tell its own eloquent tale, the unpardonable one had cut
it up into a couple of rooms&mdash;lofty indeed even then&mdash;by
dividing its height, and now the dinners of the troops
are cooked irreverently below, while the men spend their
leisure in the vaulted upper half of the Hall of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
Frescoes; painted, perhaps, by Giotto, if the faint
tradition may be believed.<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
</p>

<p>
The hall is filled with carpenters' benches, turning-lathes,
tools which lie scattered among wood shavings,
glue-pots, and various disorderly properties.
</p>

<p>
Through the enormous window at the end of this
haunted chamber of history there is a dazzling view of
the plain of the Rhone and the circle of mountains enclosing
it, Mont Ventoux, richly blue, rising magnificently
in the centre of the amphitheatre.
</p>

<p>
We thought of Petrarch's famous ascent of the mountain,
and of his reflections on the vanity of all things
when at last, after a hard scramble, he reached the
summit.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt he was tired," said the practical Barbara.
</p>

<p>
It was just what she would have said about one of her
own brothers with a similar excuse for pessimism.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps if Petrarch had had a Barbara to look after
him he would not have made so many reflections about
the vanity of things. She would have treated him as a
charming child, whose fitful moods have to be allowed for
and soothed. It is indeed a rare man whom women do
not feel called upon to treat more or less in that way!
However, Petrarch has the support of a modern very
different from himself when he complains of the disillusions
of mountain climbing. Nietzsche remarks the
same thing, but he accounts for it by the fact that the
whole charm and spell of the country has come from
the mountain which draws one to it irresistibly, but once
we are there, the sorceress is no longer visible, and so
the charm disappears.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was in this fortress-palace that the Anti-Pope
Benedict XIII. (Pierre de Luna) withstood the attacks
of Charles V., whose religious sentiments, outraged by
the schism in the Church, prompted him to send one of
his generals to drive the pretender from his stronghold.
The siege continued for months, and ruined many houses
in Avignon and killed many of the people. At last, when
the place was stormed the Pope took refuge in the tower
and finally escaped out of a secret door.

<p>
We lingered for some minutes at the great window in
the Hall of the Frescoes studying the landscape, and
trying to find out the direction of Petrarch's romantic
Vale of the Sorgue and the site of the Castle of
Romanin and Les Baux in the Alpilles. Near to the
window to our left, as a stern foreground to that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
radiant picture of Provence, stands Rienzi's tower, bare
and bald indeed. And there the last of the Tribunes
passed days of one knows not what anguish in his dark
little prison, while the sunlight beat and beat without
upon its ruthless walls. There is a touching story,
showing the honour in which the troubadour's profession
was held in those days: that the people of Avignon
interceded for the condemned patriot, pleading for his
life on the ground that he too was a singer of songs.
One is relieved to remember that at least he did not end
his days in this miserable dungeon, but met his death in
the streets of Rome, at the foot of the Capitol itself.
</p>

<p>
Alexandre Dumas says of this palace: "We find some
sparks of art shining like gold ornaments in dark armour!
These are paintings which belong to the hard style which
marks the transition from Cimabue to Raphael. They
are thought to be by Giotto or Giottino, and certainly if
they are not by these masters they belong to their age
and school. These paintings ornament a tower which
was probably the ordinary abode of the Pope, and a
chapel which was used as a tribunal of the Inquisition."
</p>

<p>
The young woman who showed us over the Palace
with sustained hauteur, told us that it was the custom
to execute papal prisoners by throwing them from the
top of Rienzi's tower. This was the only subject that
seemed to interest our guide, a young lady of very
modern type, and aggressively "equal." In case we
should have any doubt on the matter she adopted an
abrupt gait and an extremely noisy and resolved manner
of inserting the keys in the locks of the various doors
through which she admitted the sightseers. Barbara and
I would fain have hung back among the strange little
passages hidden in the thickness of the inner walls,
ominous little mole-corridors suggestive of plot and
passion such as a Court of mediæval Popes could well be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
imagined to harbour. But our guide fretted impatiently
at the exit, eager to hurry us out, and she would scarcely
vouchsafe an answer to the meekest of questions. In
fact, by the time she had given us a very much foreshortened
view of the Palace (I am convinced that she
did us out of more than half of the appointed round),
most of us felt more or less trampled upon&mdash;her equality
was such!
</p>

<p class="p2">
It is perhaps a paradox, but it is none the less true
that one does not fully realise the character of a scene till
one has left it.
</p>

<p>
Under the shadow of that terrible building we were
held by a spell, wandering bewildered from dusky corridor
to darker chamber, scarcely able to take count of our own
impressions. They were so strong and they came so fast.
</p>

<p>
But once out again in the sunshine, we found that the
images grouped themselves into gloomy pictures, and all
the crime and all the splendid misery of that wonderful
stage of mediæval drama seemed to crowd before the
mind's eye, re-peopling the melancholy place with
brilliant figures, filling it with voices and all the indescribable
sound and murmur of a stirring centre of
human life.

CHAPTER V
</p>

<p class="center">THE CITIES OF THE LAGOONS
</p>

<p>
The rivers of Provence are strangely fascinating; perhaps
because they so dominate and ensoul the country, and
because of their tumultuous flowing. The really fascinating
thing for the living is life!
</p>

<p>
The river Asse is so impetuous that a proverb has
grown up about it: "l'Asse; fou qui la passe."
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And fleet Durance ...</p>
<p>Rugged in gait as wild of appetite...."</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
The Rhone has a little wind all to herself; the west
wind that is called <i>lou rosau</i>, the Provençal name for the
river being <i>la Rose</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Rhone and the Durance are very different in
character, though it would take some telling to make
the distinction clear. Both are swift and strong, but
the Durance is always a wild mountain creature, clear
and singing, while the Rhone is more humanised, more
experienced, more profound in the still passion of its
flowing.
</p>

<p>
Its calm is perfect, its storm tremendous. <i>Rohan le
taureau</i> is a name well deserved when the mistral
descends from the mountains, waking the "majestic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
music" of the river; impetuous, stormy, but always
with that mysterious under-note of calm that seems to
belong to all great things. Even the stern St. Jerome
called the persuasive Hilarius "the Rhone of eloquence,"
because nothing could resist the seductive power of his
language.
</p>

<p>
"His waves like herded cows that roar and bound" is
one of Mistral's many descriptions of the river which
has inspired poet after poet and traveller after traveller
with a sense of its splendid power and beauty.
</p>

<p>
It is to the rivers, those patient builders, that the
Gulf of Lyons owes its curious formation which is of
extraordinary interest to the geologist as well as to the
historian and the artist.
</p>

<p>
It was when the glacial epoch of the world was just over
and the great glaciers were breaking up along the valleys
that lead down to the Mediterranean that the present
contours of the Gulf of Lyons began to form. It is the
old story of river-borne material forming deltas and bars,
but in this case, perhaps because of the great number of
rivers&mdash;(the Tech, the Aude, the Olbe, the Hérault, the
Vidourle, the Durance, and above all the Rhone)&mdash;there
has arisen a sort of twin-coast; a double shore enclosing
a complicated series of lagoons or <i>étangs</i> producing a
labyrinth of land and lake; "ephemeral isles," and
wandering waterways, long stretches of sand-dunes&mdash;shores
that fly before the wind&mdash;great swamps and
deserts such as the Rhone-enclosed island of the
Camargue and the plain of the Crau. In its desolate
way, this coast of many changes and fortunes is one of
the most interesting features of the country.
</p>

<p>
On the outer beach break the waves of the Mediterranean;
the inner is bathed by the smooth waters of the
great chain of lagoons, blue, lonely, strangely bright and
still.

<p>
This lake system in the early centuries was the scene
of active navigation and commerce, and on its shores
were brilliant cities. A canal or <i>grau</i> connected the
lagoons with the sea, and these avenues in the prosperous
days were kept carefully open so that the sea
could enter and keep the water fresh and moving, and
so perfectly wholesome.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, as one by one the great ports fell into decay,
the canals were neglected and the lakes became stagnant,
silting up and so developing into poisonous morasses, till
the whole dismal regions in the Middle Ages became a
place of death.

<p class="caption">AIGUES MORTES FROM THE CAMARGUE.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let any traveller cross the Camargue on some calm
afternoon in winter, leaving the wonderful dark walls and
towers of Aigues Mortes behind him on the marshy
plain, and he will probably be disinclined to admit that
any important changes can have taken place since those
unhappy days. Nevertheless vast improvements have been
made, at any rate as regards hygienic conditions; and
though still dangerous in the hot season, these swampy
spaces cannot rival the old appalling death-roll which
in certain times of the year would summon so many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
victims from the marsh-encircled towns that there were
not sufficient hands left to bury them.
</p>

<p>
At Aigues Mortes the people used to say that the fever
held its spring assizes, and there were out of 1,500 inhabitants
never less than five or six deaths per day.
</p>

<p>
Aigues Mortes is but one of the Dead Cities of the
coast; some of these are still existing in that sadly pensive
way in which once active and famous centres survive
their time of glory; while others are ruined or have
altogether disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The series begins at Port Vendre (Portus Veneris),
following the coast eastward past Narbonne, Aigues
Mortes, Marseilles (the most famous of all, with its
Phocæan colonists) to Olba, whose site every traveller
passes on his dusty way to the Riviera.
</p>

<p>
Many of these ancient cities are now inland, but
formerly they were still on the shore; as, for instance,
Rousillon (the ancient Roscino), Narbonne, and Illiberis.
This last is so ancient that Pomponius Mela and Pliny
are quoted as having referred to it as "once a great and
glorious city." In their day it was reduced to a small
village. Its name is thought to be Iberic or Basque, and
signifies a new town (Illi beris).
</p>

<p>
One seems never able to get back far enough to arrive
at the beginning of Illiberis, for the city that was already
decayed in Pliny's time had a predecessor called Pyrene,
named after the daughter of the king of the mysterious
Ligurian race of Bebrykes. Pyrene had for a lover no
less a person than Hercules, and she gave her name
to the capital of the Bebryke Kingdom and to the great
chain of mountains that dominate it.
</p>

<p>
These vast masses of the Pyrenees seem to be the only
fixed thing in this region of deltas; this strange, lone
land, which rises and flees in a mist before one's eyes,
gathering now here, now there in restless dunes, encroaching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
on the sea at this point, falling back at that;
always wandering and wild; shifting, drifting against
the walls of ancient cities; stirring, shivering in forgotten
corners, by forsaken ways and shrines; silting up round
old wrecks or ruins of years ago, till an island or a mount
is born out of the waste; giving way before the rush of
some swollen current, as it breaks forth into a fresh
channel with bright, victorious waves bearing new
fortunes to whole regions along the coast.
</p>

<p>
Among the many races that have populated this
shore, besides the great and far-reaching Ligurians and
Iberians, there were the agricultural Volscians in the
fifth century and the Sordares or Sordi, another traditional
half-fabulous people who belonged chiefly to the
country about Rousillon, the ancient Roscino.
</p>

<p>
The whole coast was haunted by the Phœnicians from
the earliest times; and the Volscians held a large part of
the region for centuries, cultivating the land in quiet
bucolic fashion. Narbonne, Agatha (Agde), Brescon,
Forum Dimitti (Frontigen), St. Gilles, Maguelonne,
Aigues Mortes, were among these old cities or ruins,
of which Narbonne alone is of much importance
to-day.
</p>

<p>
When they were flourishing, the country was more or
less covered with vegetation; and of a dream-like loveliness
these twin-shores must have been with their fair
cities dotting the green shores; towers and palaces
repeating themselves in the stillness of the lagoons;
gliding ships richly laden threading the waterways,
passing and repassing; a fresh little wind coming in
from the sea, and the vast blue of those waters stretching
forth to the edge of the world!
</p>

<p class="p2">
The most ancient of the dead cities, those whose
origin recedes far back before the Roman occupation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
are generally a few miles inland, and mark the old line
of the coast.
</p>

<p>
Narbonne, the famous capital of Gallia, was, like all
the Celtic cities, sombre and severe in aspect, with
mortarless walls of enormous blocks of stone. The
people of Marseilles who traded with Narbonne "found
no charm in these marshy solitudes beaten by all the
winds in the midst of the indefinite and shallow lagoons,
which rendered almost unapproachable the grey walled
town whose sadness contrasted strikingly with the magnificence
of the elegant Massilia."
</p>

<p>
Since then the Romans have occupied Narbonne, the
Visigoths and Saracens have devastated it. This, the
first Roman colony in Gaul, was civilised and Romanised
by Fabius Maximus, a bold undertaking in the newly
conquered country inhabited by wild Ligurians and Celts.
But the Roman genius for government and colonisation
produced its usual brilliant results. Theatres, amphitheatres,
baths, temples and palaces sprang up in the
Celtic city which the traders from Marseilles had thought
so gloomy, and for many a long day Narbonne was the
most important of flourishing ports in Gaul always
excepting Marseilles the immortal.
</p>

<p>
At Narbonne have been found "monumental stones"
with small caps carved upon them. When a Roman left
in his will that certain of his slaves should be liberated, a
cap was carved upon their tombs, and so it has become
"the cap of liberty," the symbol of a freedom greater
than the freest Roman ever dreamt of.
</p>

<p>
There were also found in the burial-places of children
little rude clay toys representing pigs and horses.
</p>

<p>
More striking and unexpected than these discoveries,
however, were those of several tombs said to have been
found in the city with inscriptions proving that some
Pagans at least believed in immortality, for the survivors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
speak of looking forward joyfully to reunion in another
life with their lost ones.
</p>

<p>
The towns of Agde and Brescon, or Blascon, follow
next in the chain of dead cities, both situated on volcanic
islands at the mouth of the Hérault. If the speculations
of etymologists have brought them to a correct conclusion,
the name of Blascon proves the Phœnicians to have
known something of geology. For Blascon is thought to
be derived from the Pnician root <i>balangon</i>, to devour
with fire; so that these ubiquitous traders must have
recognised volcanic soil when they saw it.
</p>

<p>
Agde (Agatha Tyche&mdash;Good Fortune&mdash;from the happy
position of its port, nautically considered) was a Greek
colony from Marseilles carrying with it the cult of
Hellas. A temple to Diana of Ephesus was erected on
the coast, this goddess being the tutelar deity of the
mother city. A few columns of the temple are said still
to remain.
</p>

<p>
Agde was called the Black Town by Marco Polo; and
by many a luckless traveller in the Middle Ages, a Cavern
of Thieves.
</p>

<p>
Across the whole of this district between the cities,
great roads used to run; the Domitian Way being founded
on a primitive Ligurian or Celtic road, and extending
from Carthagena through Gallia Narbonensis as far as
the Rhone.
</p>

<p>
The Aurelian Way was another of these routes running
further westward, but as to its exact course, no profane
outsider may dare to pronounce. It is a subject that
destroys all peace in antiquarian circles.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It has been remarked<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> that all names on a certain line
of route, ending at Béziers in Languedoc, are Celtic,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
while all south of that route are Latin. Among the first
we find Ugernum (Beaucaire), Nemausus (Nimes), Ambrossus
(Ambrusian), Sostatio (Castelnau), Cessero (St.
Thibery), Riterræ (Béziers).<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> The second or Latin
names comprise Franque Vaux (Francavallis), Aigues
Mortes (Acquæ Mortuæ), Saint Gilles (Fanum Sancti
Ægidii), Vauvert (Vallis Viridis), Villeneuve (Villa
Nova), Mirevaux (Mira Vallis), and so forth.
</p>

<p>
From their names, therefore, one may judge whether
these towns were built before or after the Roman occupation,
and thence whether the district was above water at
that time, or at least whether it was possible for human
habitation. It appears that this historical theory tallies
precisely with the geology of the district, and that the
whole country&mdash;even including the Alpilles, whose peaks
formed islands at the beginning of our era&mdash;was covered
with the sea. Mont Majour, near Arles&mdash;where is now a
magnificent ruined castle characteristic of the country&mdash;the
Montagnette de Tarascon, a curious little limestone
height among whose recesses is perched a strange old
monastery, and one or two other places, form the sole
exceptions.
</p>

<p>
The old beach far inland can be traced easily by the
line of sand-dunes often covered with Parasol Pines and
white poplars. This line, therefore, marks the scene
of some of the great changes and events of French
history.
</p>

<p>
On the coast between sea and lagoon lies Maguelonne,
a dead city indeed, but one of the most romantic spots
in the South of France. Its fortress-church, gloomily
shrouded by a grove of pines, stands on the lonely island,
listening, one might fancy, to the incessant beat of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
waters on the deserted shores&mdash;sole remnant of a
great city.
</p>

<p>
Aigues Mortes with its wonderful walls untouched
since they were built by Philip le Hardi; St. Gilles,
in the Camargue (famous for its exquisite church), built
perhaps on the site of the Greek city Heraclea, which
had disappeared even in Philip's time; Arles, "the
Gallic Rome," the residence of Roman Emperors and
the capital of a later kingdom&mdash;these, too, belong to the
astonishing list which might lengthen itself almost indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
Each town, moreover, is the scene of geological
changes, of racial, social, and historical romance which
would take a lifetime to learn and volumes to relate.
</p>

<p>
It is a strange, sad story&mdash;if truly the decadence of
what we call prosperous cities and the desolation of
brilliant sights be sad.
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely two thousand years," says Lenthéric, "have
sufficed to convert these lagoons, formerly navigable, into
sheets of pestilential water, to annihilate this immemorial
vegetation, to transform into arid steppes this gracious
archipelago of luxuriant wooded isles, and to outline
this coast with a desolating dryness and an implacable
monotony."
</p>

<p>
But at least it is peaceful: at least it is free from the
fret and fume and tragedy of human life!

CHAPTER VI
</p>

<p class="center">THE BIRTH OF CHIVALRY
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to wander a day in Provence without
being drawn to wonder if not to speculate upon the
origin of that extraordinary outbreak of new sentiment
that we call chivalry. It seems like a miraculous birth.
It is impossible even to imagine what would have been
the destinies of mankind had the beautiful inspiration
failed to descend out of the blue just at the most brutal
epoch of European history.
</p>

<p>
The life of the early Middle Ages was barbaric beyond
all our powers of conception. Might was right in those
days in a sense perhaps more absolute than under conditions
of primitive savagery.
</p>

<p>
In fact, there existed a sort of official savagery of
Church and State. Tolerance was undreamt of; there
was no refuge for the oppressed, no rights for the weak,
no honour, no fair play. Such rights and qualities
belong to the ideals of chivalry. They had no nook or
corner in the preceding era, no niche in the Christian
Church; and the heart in which such outlandish feelings
were untimely born must either have hardened or broken&mdash;as
surely many a heart did break for sheer loneliness,
divided by centuries from its brother spirits.
</p>

<p>
An extravagant picture? Only in the sense in which
all rough sketches are extravagant.

</p>

<p>
As for the tide in the affairs of women, it was at the
neap. Lecky traces to Jewish sources a good deal of the
contempt in which they were universally held. The
tenth commandment, we may remember, enjoins that a
man shall not covet his neighbour's house, nor his wife,
nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass,
nor anything that is his; a fairly plain and unvarnished
way of expressing by inference the general view of marital
relations.
</p>

<p>
"A woman," says this author, "was regarded as the
origin of human ills"; and he quotes the saying of a
Jewish writer that "the badness of men is better than
the goodness of women." Our great-great-great-grandmothers,
we may remember, used to be sold by their
feudal lords to the highest bidder. That counts for something
in a people's destiny. "Marriage," says M. Fauriel
in his work on Provençal Poetry,<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> "was nothing more
than a treaty of peace or alliance between two seigneurs,
of whom the one took the daughter of the other as his
wife."
</p>

<p>
Repudiation, the same author says, was a common
device: in the case, for instance, of a married noble
covetous of new territory, he would become conscience-stricken
on reflecting that he was perhaps fourth cousin
of his wife, and he hurried to the Church to release him
from the burden of sin, the Church being complaisant
towards a wealthy penitent.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The exaggerated pretensions, refinements, subtleties of this
[chivalrous] love," M. Fauriel continues, "took its rise in the
interested motives of feudal marriage. The sufferings of women as
wives partly explain the adoration of the chevaliers."
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The women of those dark days were, in fact, born to
humiliation and indignity as a mole is born to burrow
in the earth. Both sexes suffered vassalage under a
feudal superior, but the woman also endured domestic
subservience. She was subject to the common lord and
to her own particular lord into the bargain.
</p>

<p>
And we must picture her as enveloped and overwhelmed
by these conditions, so that they form for her
the canopy of heaven, the very nature and ordinance of
things, a set of laws so absolute that she could not so
much as think beyond them in her wildest flights of

<p>
Patient Griselda, as we know, was the model wife of
the day, and the sentiment of the old story, in gradually
attenuating strength, has ruled the ideals and conduct of
men and women for weary centuries. Indeed, it remains
even to this day as a sort of secret substratum to our
current domestic sentimentalities. The ideal, in its
original strength, produced a society the most degraded
and miserable that the civilised world has ever seen.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to conceive anything more hopeless
than the condition of the whole population of the early
Middle Ages. Where was rescue to come from? What
could the most sanguine hope for except a very slow
movement towards better things?
</p>

<p>
Yet that was not what happened.
</p>

<p>
Into this darkness the light of a new and beautiful
ideal began to shine like a veritable ray from heaven!
</p>

<p>
The clouds seemed to part and the troubled, stupid
world became illumined with a spiritual truth which to
this hour is the source of the best that we have ever conceived
in character and manners.
</p>

<p>
Suppose it had occurred to no one that to torture and
insult a fallen foe was of all acts the most cowardly, that
treachery was essentially base; that honour, loyalty, and
fair play to friend and foe were the attributes of true
knighthood and true manhood. Suppose that nobody
had ever questioned the conduct of such ruffians as the
husband of Griselda, or saw that Griselda's patience was
in its essence mean-spirited rather than noble; suppose&mdash;but
it is wiser to suppose no further, for the records of
these old cities and castles and the dark stories that occur
even among the gayest troubadour traditions, give hints
that the mind dares not dwell upon.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to state, much more to exaggerate, the
profound and indeed creative influence of the new order,
often sinned against indeed, but serving as a standard by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
which a man is instinctively judged, and by which, in his
inmost heart, he judges himself. But to whom do we
owe this enormous debt? That question has never
received a convincing answer. Nothing could have
appeared more wildly Utopian than to hope for the birth
of such ideals at the time at which they actually arose.
To lofty motives of magnanimity, of mercy and tenderness
towards the weak, was added the most unaccountable
innovation of all: respect for, worship of women;
women whose "goodness" had a little while ago been
inferior to man's badness. Suddenly this miserable
sinner is exalted to the highest honours, set on a
pedestal, served and protected and deferred to as a being
who alone can inspire great achievements or shed a light
and a charm on the path of life.
</p>

<p>
A knight, it was said, was "the champion of God and
the ladies."
</p>

<p>
"I blush," Gibbon adds, "to unite such discordant
names."
</p>

<p>
The historian evidently does not approve of this new
dispensation, and indeed all through his writings displays
that ancient deep-seated scorn for the sex he calls frail
which chivalry itself has not banished from the heart
of man.
</p>

<p>
The new ideals, it is to be remarked, applied only to
the knight and the noble. We have moved a little
farther in regarding chivalry as an attribute of the <i>man</i>,
though the mediæval notion still lingers that its qualities
pertain <i>par excellence</i> to the "gentleman." We have yet
further to go in making them extend in their full range
to the womanly character. The notion seems to be fairly
widespread that it is feminine to be at least a <i>little</i>
treacherous!

All advance has been, and apparently must be made
along the lines of chivalry. There is not a noble deed or

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
a generous thought that does not, in its essence, belong to
this wonderful tradition which we accept so unquestioningly
that we do not even remember to ask whence it came.
Yet so fundamental is it in our most intimate thoughts
as well as in our public judgments that one can scarcely
conceive any further progress that should not consist in a
steady extension of the knightly sentiment, a generous
widening of the wisdom of the heart, till every living
being capable of joy and of suffering, the greatest and the
least, shall be gathered together under the great "Cloak
of Friendship."
</p>

<p class="p2">
The early poetry of Provence, like that of every other
country, celebrates the wars and exploits of heroes,
inspired in this case by the long conflicts with the Barbarians
and with the Saracens.
</p>

<p>
One must not forget that for centuries the people of
Gaul had enjoyed the civilisation of the Romans, more
especially in the attractive South, where those great
colonists had built splendid villas and settled down to a
cultured and luxurious life.
</p>

<p>
The Gallo-Roman society was cultivated in a high
degree, after the Roman model. The Gauls had shown
from the first great quickness in adapting themselves to
the new order, and the country had become truly and
completely Romanised, almost the only instance in history
of such an achievement. There were schools of
grammar and rhetoric in all the towns, and a Gallo-Roman
literature had sprung up, which continued to
exist for a considerable time, almost a century, after the
Barbarian invasions.
</p>

<p>
In the fifth century in Gaul men were violently discussing
the question of Materialism <i>versus</i> Spiritualism
in philosophy, and there is a treatise on the "Nature of
the Soul" of this period in which the author undertakes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
to "demonstrate the immateriality of this substance in
opposition to those who believe it inherent in the bodily
organs and as being merely a certain state or modification
of those organs." The twentieth century finds us still
busy with the question.
</p>

<p>
This civilisation, as is well known, was not by any
means immediately destroyed by the Barbarian invasions.
The Barbarians admired and imitated Roman institutions
and manners, especially the Visigoths, who were
less savage than either the Vandals, the Huns, or the
Franks.
</p>

<p>
Their first king, Ataulphe&mdash;whose capital was at
Toulouse&mdash;was more Roman than the Romans; Theoderick
II. read Virgil and Horace; and Euric made a
code of laws copied from the Theodosian code. The
Burgundian chief, Gondebaud, received as a high honour
the Roman title of "Patrician," and in his wars with
Clovis he "affected quite a Roman repugnance to him
and his Franks, on whom he disdainfully bestows the
epithet of Barbarians."
</p>

<p>
It was not till the sixth century, under the rule of the
Franks, that the decadence of literature truly began.<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>
This decadence is lamented by the famous Gregory of
Tours. "The majority of men sigh and sing, 'Woe to
our age'; the study of letters has been lost among us,
and the people have no longer a man capable of recording
the events of the times." It is for this reason that he
resolves to undertake the task of historian.
</p>

<p>
The downward movement which he bemoans continued
under the Merovingians and the Carlovingians&mdash;only
temporarily arrested by Charlemagne's revival of learning&mdash;and
the country was reduced to something little removed
from pure barbarism, though the people still
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
clung to classic customs: the cultus of fountains and
woods, practice of auguries and so forth.
</p>

<p>
In the tenth century the <i>Lingua Romana</i> was spoken
in Gaul. The end of the decomposing process had
come. The idiom had ceased to be merely corrupt
Latin, it was Romance, a definite language on a Latin
foundation, but full of words and forms belonging to the
numberless races that had inhabited or influenced the
south of Gaul.
</p>

<p>
And now with the final destruction of the old order and
language began the process of constructing the new; the
first movement of the Romance-literature, the literature
which for two centuries was to dominate Europe and to
form and found the ideals of life that we call modern.
</p>

<p>
The transition stages are marked in the history of the
Church. In the ninth century Charlemagne enjoins on
the clergy that they shall translate into Romance for the
benefit of the people their Latin exhortations, showing
that at this date the classic tongue had ceased to be
generally understood, at least in the North. In the South
it appears to have lingered longer, for at Charlemagne's
Council of Arles of about the same date no such order is
given, presumably because it was unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
Later, however, in the Churches of the South the
clergy allowed songs and responses in pure Romance to
be introduced, and this concession M. Fauriel regards as
the beginning of the movement.
</p>

<p>
He gives an amusing account of one of the earliest
specimens of Provençal literature, a dramatic version of
the parable of the wise and foolish virgins.
</p>

<p>
The foolish virgins arriving too late, appeal in vain to
the wise for oil. They refuse, but recommend a good
oil-dealer who may perhaps supply them. But he, too,
will not assent to their prayer, and alas! the Bridegroom
arrives before they have had time to come to an arrangement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
He likewise turns away from the foolish ones,
saying He does not know them; and&mdash;in a singularly un-Christian
spirit&mdash;condemns them to be at once plunged
into the deepest depths of hell.
</p>

<p>
A troop of demons come in and seize the foolish virgins
and drag them down to the flames, while, presumably,
their wiser sisters look on complacently, basking in their
own virtue and in the consequent favours of the powers
that be.
</p>

<p>
Legends of all sorts made the subjects of literary effort
at this time, among them that of the Sacred Tree, in
which its seed, with that of the cypress and the fir, is
given by an angel in the Garden of Eden to a son of
Adam. The sacred seed goes through many adventures,
first with Moses in the wilderness, then with David at
Jerusalem, where it develops so rapidly that the singer is
able to compose his psalms beneath its shade.
</p>

<p>
Solomon tries in vain to use a beam from the tree in
his temple, but it always becomes a few inches too long
whenever it is placed in position and shrinks again on
removal. Finally it is taken to be made into the Cross of
the Saviour.
</p>

<p class="p2">
At this time, just before as well as after the emergence
of the troubadour literature, the Court of Ventadour plays
an important part.
</p>

<p>
One of its counts, Eblos III., was called <i>Cantor</i> because
of his devotion to "verses of alacrity and joy." He was
a contemporary of our William the Conqueror, a fact
which perhaps helps one to place in the imagination this
cultivated little Court of Limousin.

<p>
It was a seigneur of Limousin, William IX. of Poitiers,
Duke of Acquitaine, Gascony, and many other provinces,
who is usually regarded as the first troubadour; a gay,
insouciant soldier, singer, sceptic, and free-thinker of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'></a></span>

eleventh century. He is the first <i>trouvère</i> or "finder"
(from Spanish <i>trobar</i>) whose poems have come down to
us; born in 1071, but doing his work in the succeeding
age. From this time onwards we are in the real troubadour-land,
and a multitude of singers spring up, as if at
the stroke of some magic signal, some mysterious summons
from the spiritual realm, to build a new heaven and
a new earth for the tormented, war-wearied human
race.
</p>

<p>
Many writers have tried to account for the great movement
by the worship of the Virgin Mary; but the Virgin
had been worshipped for ages before the birth of chivalry.
Certain of its qualities were doubtless fostered by the
feudal system which could only continue to exist if men
were faithful to their engagements and the word of
honour was held sacred. But there was nothing in
feudalism to foster respect for women. As we know, it
had quite an opposite tendency. Some writers trace the
institution to the Arabs, who, after the conquest of
Persia in the seventh century, absorbed the culture of
the vanquished race. Rather later than this period (as
the author of "Feudal and Modern Japan" points out),
during the golden age of those islands, with all Christian
Europe plunged in darkness, there was literary activity
nowhere manifest save in Japan, China, India, the
Eastern Caliphæte and Saracenic Spain. With only one
of these lands could the South of France have come into
direct contact, viz., Saracenic Spain. From here, therefore,
one is almost forced to conclude, came the first
definite impulse that set stirring the great emotions and
great thoughts of the new movement. The Saracen
Arabs are described as a nation of chivalrous soldiers, one
of the most cultivated and romantic of the earth, and the
Crusaders could scarcely fail to be influenced by such a
people.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Nothing can have exceeded the splendour of this
romantic Saracen Empire in Spain.
</p>

<p>
"Palaces, mosques, minarets rose like an exhalation in
vanquished Spain," writes Rowbotham in his book on the
troubadours.
</p>

<p>
The country, he says, produced a wealth of valuable
metals, loadstone, crystals, silks, corals, rubies, pearls,
and the cities were dreams of colour and Eastern loveliness,
where there was always the sound of lutes and the
enchantment of song. The Caliph lived in unimaginable
luxury at Zahra, where the "Pavilion of his Pleasures"
was constructed of gold and polished steel, the walls of
which were encrusted with precious stones. In the midst
of the splendour produced by lights reflected from the
hundred crystal lustres a sheaf of living quicksilver
welled up in a basin of alabaster. "The banks of the
Guadalquiver were lined with twelve thousand towns and
villages; lights in never-ending myriads troubled the
whole length of the stream. And as the boatmen glided
past village after village ... came the perpetual sounds of
instruments and voices."
</p>

<p>
In the sumptuous houses was generally a cool central
court with a fountain, and here for the contentment of
all good Moslems, the Saracen minstrels would come and
sing of love and beautiful ladies, while the water splashed
quietly into the basin in the languorous noonday heat.
</p>

<p>
There was no variation in the theme: always love and
beautiful ladies.
</p>

<p>
"Shut your eyelids, ye eyes of the gazelle," was the
popular mode of beginning the entertainment.
</p>

<p>
Banished from religion, "music," according to the
same author, "became to Moslems an illicit pleasure
like wine, and it grew up amid myrtle blossoms and
the laughter of women."
</p>

<p>
A life like this, splendid with colour and brilliance,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
might well have inspired imitation among the impressionable
people of Provence, and so would help to account
for certain elements in the movements of chivalry; but it
would scarcely account for the romantic adoration of the
sex which the Arabs&mdash;for all their songs in praise of
charm and beauty&mdash;treated after the immemorial fashion
of the East.
</p>

<p>
Yet we are told that the first Crusade acted as a
sort of edict for their emancipation. "Women who had
lived in constant terror ... of ill-usage and violent treatment
now came out in crowds&mdash;went to distant countries,
and a squadron of them even took up arms for the Cross.
This brought them into contact with the most gallant
men on earth, famous for their passionate adoration of
women."
</p>

<p>
One can see how all this may, and indeed must have
ousted many of the older traditions and created a new
romantic spirit. The mere fact of increased liberty and
experience for the subject sex tended to produce a
changed and more human relationship. But it is difficult
to believe that the woman of the West owes her salvation
to the Moslem!
</p>

<p>
The charm and romance of the Eastern life gave the
impetus; the increased freedom introduced a more
spiritual element, and then the quickened imagination
worked subtly as well as rapidly upon minds and hearts
already stirring with new ideas and emotions. Happily
one can inspire a great deal more than one actually
communicates.
</p>

<p>
But the land which keeps its women shut away in
harems and treats them as personal property could
scarcely teach the ideas of chivalry to the West. Woman
does not owe her redemption to the followers of Mahomet.
The paradox is unthinkable. In fact, she really owes it to
herself: to some power of intuition, a quick understanding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
of the bearing of things, of the magic of ideas as distinct
from established facts which enabled her to win a steadily
widening influence just at that favourable moment when
the new thoughts were in the air: honour, loyalty, generosity,
fair play. Then perhaps she was inspired to put
in <i>her</i> claim for fair play, and when once that notion was
really started in men's minds it seemed to take fire with
generous swiftness.
</p>

<p>
In any case, it is to the dreamers&mdash;men or women&mdash;of
the tenth or eleventh century, probably to both, that
we owe these saving ideals. Practical men of the
preceding ages doubtless laughed at them as sentimental
or subversive. Happy the land that still breeds ideas at
which the practical man laughs!

CHAPTER VII

<p class="center">THE GAY SCIENCE
</p>

<p>
The more we see of cities and castles the more our
ignorance chafes us, gets in our way. Our few books
were insufficient. There was but one thing to do: call
at the famous little bookshop in the Rue d'Agricole at
Avignon&mdash;which alluring city we made our axis of
movement&mdash;and lay in a store of enlightening literature.
</p>

<p>
The shop is now the property of the widow of the poet
Roumanille, who with Mistral and Théodore Aubanel
founded at Avignon the celebrated Félibres, that wonderful
band of poets&mdash;Troubadours of the twentieth
century&mdash;who have produced a literature in the once
despised Provençal tongue, breathing forth all the spirit
of their native land. Intense love of that land, of its
ancient language, its architecture, costume, history,
creeds, has been the inspiration of this brilliant group,
and perhaps no other outburst of song has ever been
fuller than this is of warmth, colour, joy, sorrow, and
that indefinable quality we call poetry.
</p>

<p>
The little shop in the quiet Rue d'Agricole was classic
ground, associated with many an enthusiastic meeting,
many a happy hour of talk and friendship among this
warm-hearted fraternity. It was easy to find books, but
not easy to select them. There were piles and piles of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
the works of the Félibres, and this title is claimed by a
goodly number of writers not now limited to natives of
Provence, but including Englishmen and Americans;
and women too, for this genial brotherhood welcomes
the sex worshipped by their minstrel forefathers, and
every seven years a woman receives the honour of being
crowned Queen of the Félibres.
</p>

<p>
With the kind help of Madame Roumanille, a selection
was finally made, the hard task being to choose that
which was likely to be really useful to travellers passing
through a hitherto unknown country. There were books
on every conceivable subject: the ethnology of the Midi,
with all its mystery of race and language; the Phœnicians,
the Greek colonies, the Celtic, Ligurian, and Gallic inhabitants,
endless histories of the Roman occupation
from the time when that astounding people settled in
the south-east corner of France and called it <i>Provincia</i>,
"the Province." Archæology of course has a gala time
of it in this thoroughfare of the nations, and the treasures
of art are innumerable. The list begins with implements
of the Stone Age. Provence in the Middle Ages and the
days of the troubadours of course is profusely treated.
Architecture also fares brilliantly. Besides the splendid
classic remains at Arles, Nimes, St. Remy, Orange, there
are churches of a style such as can be found in no other
part of the world; a version of the Romanesque which is
peculiar to the South of France.

A literature of controversy swells in volume daily: the
vexed question as to the spot where Hannibal crossed
the Rhone on his way through Spain to Italy having set
almost as many professors by the ears as the problem of
the exact position of the great Aurelian road, parts of
which have been destroyed. The geology and physical
geography of the littoral has occupied another set of
savants, notably the well-known Lenthéric, who treats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
with remarkable vividness what would seem a somewhat
unpopular theme: the changes in configuration of the
land and the works of natural engineering accomplished
by the Rhone as it reaches the sea by its many mouths.
Amongst all these subjects it was necessary to make a
choice; and here Barbara came to the rescue. She
wanted to know more about the troubadours. The books
we had brought with us had already awakened interest in
their romantic songs.
</p>

<p>
It soon became evident that unless we were prepared
to make a serious study of their works we must be
satisfied with a general notion of the civilisation which
they may be said to have created. Our authorities
therefore had to be consulted judiciously and the temptation
resisted to saunter down all the alluring bye-ways
that they offered. There were so many other doors to
open and curtains to raise if we desired to have even a faint
idea of the brilliant drama of this extraordinary country.

We used to seek some quiet spot in the garden on
the Rocher du Dom and read or talk as fancy dictated.
Soon we found ourselves in a very labyrinth of story
and legend. Veil after veil was lifted and the events
of bygone days began to loom out upon the background
that was still real and sunlit before our eyes. The lie
of the land, the personality of the cities, the part that
the castles had played in the romantic story, all rose
before us like some bright mirage. The very air seemed
full once more of Provençal song and dance: tenso,
chanson, rondo, pastorella, descort, ballada; and one
could almost hear the twang of lute and ring of voice
as the wind swept through the ruined windows, or we
caught the hurrying swish and murmur of the Rhone.
It was quite an excitement, in turning over the leaves
of some old volume to come upon the poems of troubadours
whose stories we had smiled or sighed over. For

there was almost always something pathetic about these
bright figures of wandering minstrels, with their fine
dress, courteous manners, ardent temperament, and too
often a disillusioned and lonely end, sometimes fighting
against the hosts of Saladin, not seldom within the

<p class="p2">
In thinking of this world of the troubadours, one must
give one's thoughts a longish tether and the imagination
a touch of the spur, for their journeyings were far and
wide over the country, from the mountain regions in
the south-eastern districts of France to the farthest
west of Languedoc and the Dukedom of Acquitaine.
There must stretch before the mind's eye the whole
beautiful region, sea-washed along its southern boundaries,
watered by splendid rivers, set with cities and
ruins whose names ring through the centuries; and
away to the north the vision must fade at its edges
into sharp peaks, while vaguely beyond, on the verge
of the consciousness, must sweep back wave after wave
of mountain country, up and up in steeper and wilder
masses to the towers and pinnacles of the Alps.
</p>

<p>
But the real heart and centre of Troubadour-land is
Provence, the region east of the Rhone and south of
the mountains of Dauphiny. It includes the whole
romantic hill-country on the spurs of the Maritime Alps;
and all along its shores to the east, the rocks cut clear
and red into the blue of that wondrous sea which has
sung its soft and ceaseless song through the tumult of
all our civilisations and of all our dreams. And beautiful
among them has been the dream of Provence!
</p>

<p>
Much of the romance and beauty is the gift of the
troubadours who taught their countrymen&mdash;nay, all
Europe&mdash;to see life with new eyes. For about two
hundred years they sang their songs; till they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
silenced in the thirteenth century by the Albigensian
wars. They were a race of singers and of lovers, for
love was the principal theme and the main interest of
their lives. Their love-stories were invariably more or
less unhappy, for not only were the times disturbed
and the dangers many, but the lovers were seldom wise
of heart or rich in knowledge of the art of life. And
so they were tossed on the sea of this rude age, on the
sea of their own wild jealousies and distrusts, and
sorrow and disappointment generally marked the end
of the romance.

<p>
The famous Rudel, hero of Rostand's "Princesse Lointaine"
who fell in love with the distant princess whom
he had never seen, and journeyed far over the sea to visit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
her, only to die in her arms almost on the instant that
he beheld her, was perhaps one of the least unfortunate
of the fraternity, for he never knew the bitterness of
disillusion; never frittered away his sentiment in little
quarrels and misunderstandings, never suffered the
miseries of jealousy.
</p>

<p>
Soon the famous names began to call up to us a
living personality like that of a friend: Raimbaut de
Vacqueiras, Bernart de Ventadour, Pierre Vidal, Cadenet,
Bertrand de Born, Guilhelm de Cabestaing, Pons de
Chapteuil.... And then the charming Countess of Die,
the Sappho of Provence whose voice "had the colour
of Alban wine" according to her modern biographer
already quoted. The leaves of the volume were always
sharply arrested when we came upon her name.
</p>

<p>
In vain, it would appear, had she a beautiful voice
and a beautiful face, for she fell in love with that
Provençal Don Juan, Count Raimbaut d'Orange, who
soon grew tired of her, as her sad songs relate.
</p>

<p>
We were delighted to come upon the following truly
disconsolate canzo, for it seemed to bring us in touch
with the poor lady:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A chantar m'er de so qu'ieu no volria</p>
<p>Tant me rancur de lui cui sui amia;</p>
<p>Car ieu l'am mais que nuilla ren que sia:</p>
<p>Vas lui n'om val merces ni cortesia,</p>
<p>Ni ma beltatz ni mos pretz ni mos sens,</p>
<p>C'atressi'm sui enganad' e trahïa</p>
<p>Com degr'esser, s'ieu fos desavinens."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
This was translated into French prose as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Le sujet de mes chants sera pènible et douleureux. Hélas!
J'ai à me plaindre de celui dont je suis la tendre amie; je l'aime plus
que chose qui soit au monde; mais auprès de lui, rien ne me sert, ni
merci, ni courtoisie, ni ma beauté, ni mon mérite, ni mon esprit. Je
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
suis trompée, je suis trahie, comme si j'avais commis quelque faute
envers lui."
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Countess goes on in the same strain at some
length. Raimbaut, it appears, was very popular with
the ladies of his brilliant world, but the poetess reminds
him that he ought to know who "best loves him and
is true withal." But no appeal moves him&mdash;to Barbara's
great annoyance.
</p>

<p>
The account of this gentleman's hardness of heart
called forth many exclamations, as I read verse after
plaintive verse. How any lady could have set so much
store on so coarse-grained and worthless a person as the
Count of Orange was difficult to understand; but as
Barbara conclusively pointed out, she had fallen in love
with him for some unfathomable reason best known to
the Laughing Gods. But it was very annoying, all that
waste of emotion and suffering. We found ourselves
almost as much troubled over it as if it had happened
to some friend whose infatuation one had tried in vain to
cure with arguments and pure reason.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange, emotional world that we were wandering
in, and as the books with which we were trying to
find a clue to the puzzle took opposite views of the
manners and ideals of the age, it was not a little
baffling. To find our way was like trying to get out
of a labyrinth. Often an author would insist that these
ardent canzos were merely conventional exercises in the
style of the day and meant nothing personal. But
the theory would not stand investigation. Hueffer, in
his book on the troubadours, says of these singers:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Frequently they may, and in some cases we positively know they
did, mistake gracious condescension for responsive love&mdash;it was the
privilege of high-born and high-minded women to protect and favour
poetry, and to receive in return the troubadour's homage."

</p>
</div>

<p>
The fact seems to be that there was perfect social
freedom for the forming of romantic friendship between
troubadours and ladies on the foundation of artistic
sympathy, and this was the relation really aimed at and
taken for granted. It was scarcely a friendship as one
now understands the term, because the attitude of the
troubadour was necessarily (according to the theory)
one of extreme homage and devotion, in which the
element of romantic love might or might not mingle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
But it was modern friendship with that devotional
attitude in addition.
</p>

<p>
One of the most striking characteristics of the age
is its "young-heartedness," the quality that every true
knight and lady was expected to show. The festivals,
the dancing, the prevalence of song and gaiety were all
an expression of that youth of the spirit which belongs
to certain epochs, races, and individuals, and is by
no means incompatible with a profound seriousness of
thought and of outlook.
</p>

<p>
It proceeded, doubtless, from the great vividness of
the life, and the immense impetus of thought and
emotion that produced and was produced by the new
ideals.
</p>

<p>
"So true it is," says John Addington Symonds, "that
nothing lives and has reality for us but what is spiritual,
intellectual, self-possessed in personality and consciousness.
When the Egyptian priests said to Solon, 'You
Greeks are always children,' he intended a gentle
sarcasm, but he implied a compliment; for the quality
of imperishable youth belonged to the true Hellenic
spirit, and has become the heritage of every race which
partook of it."
</p>

<p>
There was a characteristic Charter issued to the "King
of Youth" at one of the many festivals or celebrations
which set the whole land of Provence dancing and
rejoicing. And there was also <i>l'Abbaye de la Jeunesse</i>,
a sort of club which every town, big and little, is said
to have possessed, the members choosing a chief of the
group annually, to lead their gay processions and inspire
their songs and festivals.
</p>

<p>
One other quaint and humane institution which this
singular country boasted was the "Hospice des Mal-Mariés,"
but except the arresting title nothing seems to
have survived in the uncertain records.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The quality of young-heartedness and that other
beautiful attribute that the French call "politesse du
coeur" belonged essentially to this land and epoch.
</p>

<p>
Of course among the golden threads some very black
ones are interwoven: traits of horrible treachery and barbarity
standing out violently amidst the texture of beauty
that the finer spirits were weaving for the ennobling of
all human life; but these traits were survivals of a former
set of traditions and of the instincts which these had
created.
</p>

<p>
These lines might well describe the historical moment
of the new birth. Love was then held to be "the
ultimate and highest principle of all virtue, of all moral
merit, of all glory," and it produced&mdash;that is when it was
of the genuine kind demanded by chivalry&mdash;a state of
"happy exaltation of the sentiment and charm of life."
This age seems to have invented&mdash;or reinvented&mdash;the
"joie de vivre" and the "joy of love." It is remarkable
that the language of the troubadours had two forms of the
word <i>joy</i>: <i>joi</i> and <i>joia</i>; <i>joi</i> being used for an expansive
and energetic state of happiness, <i>joia</i> for the passive,
reposeful form of the sentiment.
</p>

<p>
While the troubadours were carrying everything before
them in Provence and Italy, the minnesingers were plying
their romantic trade in Germany; that is late in the
twelfth century; but the Gay Science had spread from
Provence to the other countries, the troubadours visiting
foreign Courts and giving lessons in their art.
</p>

<p>
This outburst of poetry is described by M. Fauriel as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"the result of a general or energetic movement in favour of social
restoration, of an intense enthusiasm of humanity reacting on every
side against the oppression and the barbarity of the epoch. The
same sentiment ... impelled them to seek and to find a new type
and new effects in the other arts, particularly in architecture.
Thence arose palaces and churches...."
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is not a little strange and satisfying to realise that
the strong wave of sentiment of which one is conscious in
all great architecture was in the Middle Ages the same
that produced the magnificent flight heavenwards of the
human imagination in all that regarded life, its problems
and its relationships. M. Fauriel, on the subject of the
freedom of chivalrous love, writes:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The exaltation of desire, of hope, of self-sacrifice by which love
manifests itself and in which it principally consists, could not have
any moral merit nor could it become a real incentive to noble actions
except on certain conditions. It was to be perfectly spontaneous,
receive no law except its own, and could only exist for a single
object."
</p>
</div>

<p>
"A woman," he continues, "could only feel her ascendancy
and dignity, as a moral being, in relations where
everything on her part was a gift, a voluntary favour, and
not in relations where she had nothing to refuse."
</p>

<p>
As an example of the darker threads we may take the
career of Guilhelm de Cabestaing, the unfortunate author
of the famous canzo, a fragment of which is printed at
the head of the chapter. He is one of the most prominent
figures in troubadour history. He celebrated the
charms of Berengaria des Baux, but his real love was for
the wife of the Count of Rousillon, a ferocious person who
suspected the troubadour's passion and set to work to
entrap him by questions as to the state of his heart.
Guilhelm, seeing his danger, admitted that he was
seriously in love, but with the wife of another seigneur.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said the Count, pretending great sympathy,
"I will help you in your suit; we will go at once
to the castle of the fair lady."
</p>

<p>
Guilhelm had reluctantly to go, dreading the worst;
but the lady, realising the situation, played up to the
part, acknowledging her love for Guilhelm, and the
Count's suspicions were thus allayed, but only to be
aroused again by the canzo ("lou douz cossire") which
Sermonda asked her lover to write to assure her that his
faithlessness was only apparent. The gruesome end
of the story, the treacherous slaying of the troubadour,
the serving up of the heart at table to the wife, and
her suicide on hearing the ghastly truth, illustrates too
well the darker side of the life of the epoch.

<p>
Pons de Chapteuil was a troubadour whose story
greatly interested us, partly because of the romantic
idea of the two mountain-set castles, one the home of
Pons, at Chapteuil, near Le Puy, the other that of
Alazais of Mercoeur, about twenty-five miles distant, "as
one would measure across the mountains of Auvergne,"
says Justin Smith in his charming account of the story.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Really it seems a little strange and eerie," he exclaims,
"the romance between these two castles in the
sky&mdash;a little like a love-affair between the Jungfrau and
the Finsteraarhorn."
</p>

<p>
The story was tender and bright and sad, as love-stories
are apt to be, and very characteristic of the time.
First the admiration and sympathy and the necessary
adoration, then the taking fire of two generous natures;
for this time the hero of romance is one to claim our
admiration as a noble follower of the laws of chivalry.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It was his pleasure to defend the weak of every sort, to be brave,
true, faithful, liberal, and always to stand for the right."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Alazais had been married, probably by her father or
her feudal over-lord, to Count Ozil de Mercoeur, for
whom she made no pretence of any feeling, not even
of esteem. It was evidently a <i>mariage de convenance</i>,
as most marriages were in those days, and the love of the
Countess of Ozil for her neighbour across the mountains
at least did not rob the Count of her affections, since he
had never possessed or apparently desired them.
</p>

<p>
"In essential womanliness," says Justin Smith, "and
in the graceful arts of social intercourse, we may think of
her as the equal of any lady we have met.... Courtliness
was her abiding principle, the true courtliness which
consisted in ... graceful speech, in avoiding all that
could annoy others, and in doing and saying everything
that could make one loved." The mutual attraction of
these two, the same writer continues, "penetrated by the
fire of two ardent natures, came to be love, as the rich
flow of the grape, changing its quality insensibly, acquires
in time the sparkle, the bouquet, and the passion that
make it wine."
</p>

<p>
Taking into consideration the times in which they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
lived, one would suppose that fortune favoured these
two, and that for once one should have a nice cheerful
story to console us for the many sad ones.
</p>

<p>
But no; Pons must needs harbour doubts of the
sincerity of Alazais, and so he determined to test her
by the time-honoured device of exciting jealousy. He
therefore proceeded to devote himself ostentatiously to
another lady, expecting a "burst of passionate anger"
from Alazais. But that lady, one is glad to learn, disdained
reproaches and kept a dignified silence. After all,
she seems to have argued, Pons was not bound to devote
himself to her or to continue to do so if he were tired
of it.
</p>

<p>
So Pons, much astonished and chagrined, "became
uneasy," as we are told, "quitted the lady of Roussillon,
and returned to pray for pardon." But Alazais apparently
thought that trying experiments upon a person one professes
to love was somewhat inconsequent, and she
intimated that she preferred not to receive Pons. He
sent her a song, explaining his conduct.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, if you ask what urged me to depart," it begins
(although, in fact, Alazais had never asked anything of
the kind, much to the troubadour's annoyance)&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Twas not inconstancy nor fickleness;</p>
<p>It was a wish conceived of love's excess,</p>
<p>To try the test of absence on your heart.</p>
<p>How grieved I, how regretted, when to me</p>
<p>That you were touched nor word nor token proved!</p>
<p>But think not that you're free although unmov'd:</p>
<p>From you I cannot, will not severed be!"</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
But Alazais replied never a word. His influence over
her seemed to have been entirely lost. Pons then
"employed three ladies to plead his cause," and they
entered so warmly into the undertaking that finally they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
succeeded. So Pons made another song, very joyous this
time, swearing that "henceforth he will keep strictly to
the path of love, without deviating a hair's-breadth."
</p>

<p>
But in the midst of this new-found happiness Alazais
falls ill and dies.
</p>

<p>
Barbara was much aggrieved. I scarcely liked to read
her the end: how Pons wrote a piercing lament, saying
he would close his heart and rend his strings, and
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
"Die tuneless and alone,"
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
a resolve which he actually carried out. He became a
member of one of the military brotherhoods of the day,
and died fighting in the Third Crusade.
</p>

<p>
This story, however, sad as it is, is among the most
attractive of the troubadour romances, because the
characters of Pons and Alazais were, on the whole, a
near approach to the chivalric standard for men and
women.
</p>

<p>
"When Pons" (to quote Justin Smith once more)
"rode out of the lists, bearing his lady's glove in
triumph, he felt a joy quite fresh in the experience of
mankind."
</p>

<p>
This is, after all, a big fact, and it disposes once and
for ever of the depressing doctrine that there is nothing
new under the sun. If the twelfth century produced
a new and beautiful fact in human history, so can the
twentieth.

CHAPTER VIII
</p>

<p class="center">ORANGE AND MARTIGUES
</p>

<p>
Every one who has travelled in mountain regions has
been puzzled by the curious fact that the more peaks his
journeyings reveal to him the more there are to reveal.
The number of the mountains seems to increase in
geometrical proportion and the traveller has presently to
learn that, in spite of all appearances, the last towering
summit that moves into view will presently become the
platform from which he must crane his neck to contemplate
a still more towering wooer of the clouds and a still
grander scene of desolation and primæval silence.
</p>

<p>
The traveller in Provence receives a similar impression
in relation not to material but to historical immensities.
No sooner has one spot been explored, than another
mountain-peak of tradition comes into sight, luring ever
farther afield.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the pains of the ardent traveller, and it
forms a curious analogy with the life-journey itself, in
which renunciation after renunciation has to be made,
not merely of things far distant and beautiful, but of
things beautiful and near, which only need the stretch of
the hand to touch, but yet are farther from reach than
the Pole-star itself. Among the serious renunciations
that had to be made during our Provençal visit must be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
counted Courthéson, where one of our favourite troubadours,
Raimbaut de Vacquciras, spent so many of his
early days at the Court of Guilhelm des Baux (of
whom more hereafter). Then there was Ventadour&mdash;not
exactly near, but still within hail&mdash;once so brilliant a
centre of learning and song; and Salon, the reputed
scene of Mary Magdalene's later life. Of this bright
little prosperous city, famous for its oil trade, with its
dripping fountain and grey donjon, we did catch an
early morning glimpse <i>en route</i> for an inexorable train.
Rocamadour, full of romantic beauty; Le Puy, strangest
of rock-set cities; ill-fated Béziers, of the Albigensian
wars; Dragignan, and a hundred others were one and all
alluring and unattainable.

some perfidious inhabitant whose misdirection would have
landed us in the suburbs, had not Fortune, in the shape of
a dapper youth in the first rosy flush of a dawning
moustache, come to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
In the pursuit of his father's trade as a corn-dealer,
he had travelled and learnt English together with a
becoming admiration for the British nation, his enlightenment
being assisted by an English mother. It seemed
strange to think of an Englishwoman settled down in
this little French provincial town, but as our guide
chattered on, unconsciously revealing the life of the
place, it was clear that French provincial human nature
is much the same as any other. Heartburning, gossip,
jealousies, stupendous proprieties, "convenances" of the
most all-shadowing and abstruse kind made up the
dreary existence of the inhabitants. Wretched "jeunes
filles" unable to cross a street unattended, mothers on
the prowl for husbands for the "jeunes filles" (our
young friend intimated delicately that he had a perilous
time of it among enterprising parents); the men
intent on business and the recreations of the <i>café</i> and
so forth&mdash;it all sounded disheartening enough, and the
hopelessness of it seemed to settle on the spirit like a
blight.
</p>

<p>
Our guide regarded his native town with disdain. Its
narrow streets and dingy aspect he pointed out with
ironical pomp.
</p>

<p>
"This, you see, is our main street. Magnificent you
cannot deny!" Had he not travelled and seen better
things?
</p>

<p>
But the great monuments?
</p>

<p>

The great Roman theatre stands apart from the rest of
the buildings, a vast, blank surface of masonry forming

It was hard sometimes to steer among so many possibilities

never ready for their coming. To the truly wise and

unknown. Its possessor would be able to meditate

for students of Serenity. This was Martigues, the little
town on the Etang de Berre, where all good painters go
when they die. They also wisely go there in swarms
before they die. They place here, in opposition to
orthodox scholarship, the site of the Garden of Eden.
And judging by their records, this, if mistaken, is not
surprising. The place induces on a suitable temperament
a sort of sketching debauch:&mdash;Martigues from the
Lagoon; Old Houses, Martigues; Churches, Martigues;
Groups of Boats, Martigues; Nooks and Corners,
Martigues; the Harbour, Martigues; Sailors and Fishermen,
Martigues; Martigues in the Morning; Martigues
at Noon; Martigues at Night; Martigues <i>ad infinitum</i>.
</p>

<p>
Quiet waterways among the mellowest of old houses,
churches keeping tranquil guard above the ripple of the
lagoon; the silence of the sunny port cheerily broken by
cries of sailors and bargemen, by the drowsy life of the
place; lights and shadows, colour in every tone, form in
a thousand avatars; creepers clambering over decaying
walls, flowers in odd crannies; all this offers infinitely
more attraction to the artist than all our Horticultural-Gardens-of-Paradise
put together. So it is not to Heaven
that he goes, if he can help it; he goes to Martigues.
</p>

<p>
He is never tired of it, as his numerous sketches show.

Not to have seen Martigues is a precious privilege in
its way: it is a life-long safeguard against satiety; for
then, whatever comes, <i>one</i> unfulfilled desire at least
remains: to see Martigues&mdash;and sketch!

CHAPTER IX
</p>

<p class="center">
ROMANTIC LOVE
</p>

<p>
Criticise and condemn as we may the conceptions of
the time, the institution of chivalry accomplished a
marvellous work of regeneration wherever it was able
to establish itself.
</p>

<p>
One can but turn with emotion and gratitude to the
land where it has blossomed into some of its most
beautiful forms, where the warm blood of the South
took fire and impelled to the following of noble ideals
with the ardour of heroes and the steadfastness of
saints.
</p>

<p>
Greek, Celtic, Phœnìcian, Iberian, Ligurian, Saracen
blood flows in the veins of the people; and in looking
at their faces one can understand why the troubadours
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
sang such sweet and merry songs, and why the country
to this day may be called the land
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Of joy, young-heartedness, and love...."
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
It was the Duke of Acquitaine, himself a troubadour,
who gave us those words so descriptive of Southern
France, in the gay little verse,&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A song I'll make you worthy to recall,</p>
<p>With ample folly and with sense but small,</p>
<p>Of joy, young-heartedness, and love will I compound it all."</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
In truth it was a wonderful time, full of colour and
passion in which there was the shadow of tragedy, but
seldom the grey and dust-colour of the sordid and
the mean.
</p>

<p>
For women it was literally a coming-of-age. A modern
author speaks about the "advent of woman in man's
world," when she "became for the first time something
more than a link between two generations."
</p>

<p>
Love, as a romantic sentiment, became possible
between men and women, because the woman's individuality
as a human being was recognised, and with
it her right to give or to withhold her love. True love
and true friendship, as we moderns understand them, may
almost claim to take their rise in the age of chivalry.
</p>

<p>
Fraternity of arms constituted an honoured tie among
knights. They received the Sacrament together, exchanged
armour, and from that time forth supported
one another wherever they went, and at all hazards.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"From this day forward ever more</p>
<p>Neither fail, either for weal or wo,</p>
<p>To help other at need.</p>
<p>Brother be now true to me,</p>
<p>And I shall be as true to thee."</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
This brotherhood in arms, however, should perhaps be
described as a revival of an ancient idea, whereas love,
as it developed under the laws of chivalry, was a
thing hitherto unknown to mankind. Doubtless there
had been obscure precursors of the ideal, for many
times must a new thought be uttered before the air
vibrates with sufficient strength to awake answering
movements in other minds. The first to think and feel
a new world into existence&mdash;which is the ultimate mission
of thinking and feeling&mdash;often leaves nothing but
that new world behind him; neither name, nor fame, nor
fortune. And so we shall never know in what noble
hearts the true romantic love between man and woman
first sprang into being.
</p>

<p>
The new mode of thought kindled generous impulses.
Often fantastic, not to say ridiculous, they were always
graceful and full of the flavour of romance.
</p>

<p>
"Many a knight," we are told, "would sally forth from
a besieged town during a suspension of hostilities and
demand whether there was any cavalier of the opposite
host who, for love of his lady bright, would do any deed
of arms."
</p>

<p>
"Now let us see if there be any amorous among you,"
was the usual conclusion of such a challenge. And out
would come prancing some armoured knight from the
gates of the city, and the two, with much ceremony of
salutation, would fall to and hack each other to pieces
with the utmost courtesy and mutual respect.
</p>

<p>
"The air was rent with names of ladies" in the big
tournaments of the day. "On, valiant knights, fair eyes
behold you!"
</p>

<p>
The proclamation of the beauty of his lady, as all
romances of that day remind us, was one of the serious
duties of the knight, and Cervantes only slightly caricatures
the custom when he makes Don Quixote "station
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
himself in the middle of a high road and refuse to let
the merchants of Toledo pass unless they acknowledged
there was not in the universe a more beautiful damsel
than the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso."
</p>

<p>
There was also a sort of official post or title, <i>Poursuivant
d'Amour</i>, the knight dedicating himself to love
as to a religion with solemn fervour. The Duke of
Lancaster, says Froissart, "possessed, as part of his
inheritance in Champagne, the Castle of Beaufort, of
which an English Knight called Poursuivant d'Amour
was Captain." It appears that this was a title which
knights used to give themselves on account of wearing
the portraits or colours of their mistress and challenging
each other to fight in her honour.
</p>

<p>
To be in love was a social necessity. It was hopelessly
"bad form" to be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
"A knight without love is an ear of wheat without
grain," says some authority of the day.
</p>

<p>
It certainly was a lovelorn time! "Love was everything,"
says Justin Smith, an author whose two large
volumes on the troubadours testify to wide study of the
subject, "and we cannot wonder that much was made
of it. Its hopes and fears were the drama of that day.
Sweet and passionate thoughts were the concert and the
opera. Tales of successful and unsuccessful wooing were
the novels.... Love, as we are to learn, was the shoot
of modern culture, and the tree that now overspreads
us with its boughs bloomed, even in their time, into a
poetry as unsurpassed and as unsurpassable after its kind
as the epics of Homer."
</p>

<p class="p2">
But this immense change in the attitude of mind
towards life and towards women naturally could not take
place without producing a universal upheaval of the
current morality: a thorough upsetting of the doctrines
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
upon which the husband had hitherto founded an
authority practically limitless.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-151" id="i-151"></a>

<p class="caption">IN THE CAMARGUE, FROM THE RAILWAY.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
For women obedience and morality had been synonyms.
The wife was "good" in proportion as she acknowledged
by word and deed her husband's "rights" over her, as
over any other of his possessions. Conduct implying
independence, an infringement on these "rights," was
the acme of wickedness. To act as if she belonged to
herself was a sort of embezzlement, and of course this
was the case still more unpardonably if she made so free
as to bestow her heart on some other man; then they
both became involved in the sin of purloining that which
belonged to another. To flirt was a sort of petty peculation.
It was because she so belonged to him, as real
property, that the husband thought his "honour" injured
by his wife's conduct, quite irrespective of any wound
to his affections. If a man fails to keep a possession,
given securely into his hands by law and custom and
universal sentiment, he must indeed be a sorry sort
of lord and master! Such was the popular view of
the case, and the coarser and more brutal the society
the more violent was this feeling of wounded vanity or
"honour," as it was pompously called. But suddenly&mdash;or
at least without traceable gradations&mdash;this bulwark
of marital sovereignty was rent as by an earthquake,
and the idea began to get abroad that the woman
somewhat <i>belonged to herself</i>; no longer entirely to her
feudal or to her domestic lord. Had this new idea taken
complete and undisturbed possession, it would have
worked out a modern society very different from the
society that now exists. But it did not obtain such
mastery. It only shared the field with its predecessor.
The confusion of standard was therefore extreme, for
nobody paused to separate and choose between the two
ideals; they were held simultaneously, nor is it only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
in the time of the troubadours that men and women
hold beliefs about social matters that are mutually
destructive.
</p>

<p>
So the old rights of property in the wife continued
to hold sway even while she began dimly to feel and
inwardly to claim the right to herself, with the resulting
right to bestow her love where she pleased, or where she
needs must. And that wrought wonderful changes.
</p>

<p>
One must approach this imaginative, passionate world,
if we desire to understand it, with a spirit swift to detect
differences and shades of feeling, to muster all the local
conditions before the imagination; and one must banish
scrupulously all ready-made maxims belonging to our own
day, for these at once place us outside the epoch that
we are trying to enter. It is this difficulty, this subtlety
in the subject, which makes the study of that age and
country so keenly interesting to all who are curious
of the movements of human thought as it grows and
changes under the pressure of its varying destinies.
</p>

<p>
These new ideals were now universal among kings and
princes and all who had any pretensions to cultivation
and good breeding. Love-affairs of which a married
woman was the heroine were looked upon as essentially
belonging to the chivalric order of things.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"These Courts of Love laid down rules for love," says Baring-Gould;
"they allowed married women to receive the homage of
lovers, and even nicely directed all the symptoms they were to
exhibit.... There is the case of Dante and Beatrice, and of Wolfram
von Eschenbach, one of the noblest and purest of singers, who
idealised the Lady Elizabeth of Harlenstein.... It is precisely
this unreal love, or playing at love-making, that is scoffed at by
Cervantes in Don Quixote and the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso."
</p></div>

<p>
Of course, in this state of things there was much that
seemed disorderly and was disorderly if the older view is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
to remain, in any sense, as a standard. Indeed it was, in
some respects, perhaps, disorderly from <i>any</i> point of view,
as was inevitable during so vast an upheaval of social
conditions. It was a battle of good and evil, but infinitely
in advance of the previous state, when there was no
battle, because evil was securely enjoying uncontested
possession. From that enthroned and law-supported
wrong there seemed no escape except through the "moral
chaos"&mdash;if so it really was&mdash;of the troubadour era.
Certainly the men and women of that time treated life
very boldly and frankly, and they talked more about
sentiment and the joy of life than about morality; but
the atmosphere which lingers around them, as one feels
it in their songs and stories, in all the delicate courtesy
of their manners, the dignity and fineness of their sentiments,
makes it impossible to think of them as essentially
base or unlovable, whatever condemnation their departure
from ancient standards may induce moralists to pronounce
upon them.
</p>

<p>
Their ideals may have been false; that is a matter of
individual opinion; but they lived in devotion to those
ideals with an enthusiasm that has never been surpassed.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the long repression, the second-hand vicarious
existence suffered for so many ages by women, had made
them almost intoxicated with this new experience, this
coming of age as human beings, this entering into
possession of themselves.
</p>

<p>
It was like a re-birth, and tempted to all sorts of wild
adventures. Rebellion was in the air, and especially was
it rife on all questions of love. As a recent writer
remarks, men and women began to love each other
because they should not have done so.
</p>

<p>
But love was treated very seriously as well as very
fancifully. There was no aspect in which it did not play
an important <i>rôle</i> in this extraordinary age.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It set vielles lightly tinkling and lutes twanging, but
it also took possession of great hearts and minds and
ruled them for a lifetime. Love was sometimes a "lord
of terrible aspect," as Dante has represented him. As
women developed personality and individual qualities in
their new freedom, the <i>grande passion</i> became for the
first time really possible. And their mental and spiritual
development tended to promote the growth of the character
of men in the same direction.
</p>

<p>
There seemed a sort of expectation running through
the society of that time that a new source of joy had
been found, a force that was to redeem and beautify
life.
</p>

<p>
The author of "The Women of the Renaissance"
represents the men of this later age&mdash;which, however,
was still inspired by the chivalric outburst&mdash;asking themselves
what was the good of learning, money, labour, or
even semblances of joy if their hearts were empty.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The heart," they complain, "makes itself felt above the claims of
work, above the intellect, demanding for life a recompense, a goal.
We perish for lack of something to love; out of mere self-pity we
ought to bestow on ourselves the alms of life, which is love. All is
vanity save this vanity, for before our birth, until our death, throughout
our whole existence it bears in front of us the torch of life."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Looking back from this point to the Griselda-epoch, we
have travelled far indeed!
</p>

<p>
With such aspirations, such ideas in the air (whether
or not they were expressed in a definite way), marriage,
which carried Griselda-associations with it, was naturally
looked upon as altogether outside the realm of romance
or happiness.
</p>

<p>
"To mingle it with love, the absolute, great enthusiasms
of heart or intellect, was to lay up for oneself
disasters, or at least certain disappointment," says M. de
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
Maulde de La Clavière, and he instances as the object of
ridicule in that era a lady who speaks with a sigh of the
"unaccustomed pleasure" of loving the man she married.
He defines the Renaissance view of wedlock as "the
modest squat suburban villa in which you eat and sleep:
passion is a church spire piercing the sky...."
</p>

<p>
That being the general consensus of opinion on
the subject, it is not surprising that nearly all the
love-stories of that day are entirely disconnected with
the idea of marriage. The holy estate itself was
defined as "the suburbs of hell." Marriages were
"unions of policy and position." And almost without
exception they were arranged by the parents, in
accordance with material considerations, the old feudal
idea lingering on in this department of life and
the daughter being handed over by the father to a
suitable (or unsuitable) husband, without his ever dreaming
of consulting her views in the matter. She was
generally too inexperienced to have any views of importance,
and even had she been consulted probably
would not, at that time, have been able to make a much
better choice than her father made for her.
</p>

<p>
But clearly if that was the order of things, love and
romance must establish their kingdom outside of marriage,
and this was exactly what occurred.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Since love is, by the nature of things, free and spontaneous,
rebellion and revolution were inevitable unless womankind were
to become something else than human."
</p>
</div>

<p>
The point of view becomes clearer in the light of some
of the decisions and rules of the Courts of Love; for even
if, as so many writers insist, these tribunals never really
existed, the quoted rules and judgments must at any rate
represent the ideas that swayed the society of the day.

These courts were said to be held under the presidency
of some great lady of the district, assisted by a council of
ladies and knights.
</p>

<p>
One of the questions submitted to the Court of the
Comtesse de Champagne was: "Can true love exist
between two persons who are married?"
</p>

<p>
And the Countess, aided by her councillors, pronounced
as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Therefore, having examined the said arguments by the aid of
sound science, we proceed hereby to enact that love cannot extend
his laws over husband and wife, since the gifts of love are voluntary,
and husband and wife are the servants of duty. Also between the
married can there be in our opinion no jealousy, since between them
there can be no love.... This is our decision, formed with much
deliberation and with the approval of many dames; and we decree
that it be held firm and inviolable."

<p>
This decree proved a serious stumbling-block to one
betrothed lady who had promised a cavalier that if ever
she should find herself at liberty, she would accept his
devotion. "Presently she married the lover to whom she
was plighted, whereupon the second knight resumed his
suit, conceiving&mdash;according to the ideas of the day&mdash;that
the lady was now fully at liberty. She, however, could
not be persuaded against the evidence of her feelings, ...
and the matter was referred to the queen, Eleanor, wife
of Henry II. of England. Her award could not run
counter to that of the Countess of Champagne, who
has pronounced that love cannot exist between husband
and wife. It is our decree, therefore, that the dame
aforesaid keep faith with her cavalier."
</p>

<p>
The only means of evading this decree was for the lady
to declare that henceforth she intended to abandon love
altogether, but if she did that she was obliged to make up
her mind to endure social ostracism, for then "she was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
sure to be shunned by the gay ladies and gentlemen who
then formed the vast majority of the fashionable world."
We are not told what the lady decided to do in this most
trying dilemma.
</p>

<p>
Altogether the state of society under the sway of the
Courts of Love&mdash;or of the sentiment they represent&mdash;seems
like that of some strange fairy-tale. Nothing
could have been more fantastic or romantic; but however
ridiculous they may seem to the critical mind, there was
always a strain that one can only call noble running
through it all. It might be dangerous, impracticable,
subversive, "immoral," if one will, but it was never
paltry or base.
</p>

<p>
In their own fashion the reputed Courts of Love upheld
a very high ideal. They insisted upon the absolute
sacredness of a promise and of the word of honour, which
a knight or a lady must keep to the death. They
demanded fidelity between lovers, for that was considered
"to be the essence of high-toned gallantry."
</p>

<p>
All this is our own inheritance of to-day. As regards
the etiquette of love-making the Court instituted what
were called the four degrees of love: "hesitating,"
"praying," "listening," and "drurerie." "When the
lady consented to enter this last stage, she granted the
gentleman his first kiss ... after which there could be
no withdrawal from the engagement."
</p>

<p>
The lady was often unwilling to give it, and there are
many stories of troubadours who try to obtain it by fraud
or artifice. It seems strange that, in that case, in a
society with a high sense of honour, it should have
possessed any binding value, but apparently it had something
of the quality of the marriage ceremony, and
therefore, perhaps, something of the idea of a tie which
might be enforced against the will of the person
concerned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is difficult, perhaps impossible, for the modern eye
to see this era exactly as it was. Writers represent it as
corrupt and unlovely or as romantic and noble according
to their own particular bias. The former attitude is
perhaps largely determined by a leaning towards the older
order of thought which the advent of chivalry challenged;
while the less severe view is apt to accompany sympathy
with the newer doctrine, which establishes the woman as
an independent being, for good or for evil, and refuses to
regard her as the property in any sense whatever&mdash;whether
by gift or by "contract"&mdash;of another person.
As this latter ideal is in its infancy even yet, the majority
of writers see little in the troubadour epoch but hopeless
licence. It is to them merely an outbreak of "immortality,"
and neither the passionate rebellion against an
old and degrading system nor the enthusiastic reaching
out towards something better saves it from their severe
condemnation. But we have all of us good reason to be
thankful for this stage of social upheaval through which
our spiritual ancestors passed, and it ill becomes us to
cast reproaches at those who have brought us, in one
great burst of inspiration, so much farther on our way.

"The name of Arles has raised great discussions.... Some see in
it a Greek origin, <i>Agns</i>, others regard it as Latin, <i>Ara lata</i> (raised
altar), because the Romans there found an altar consecrated to Diana
of the Ephesians by the Phoceans of Marseilles: ... others as Celtic
<i>Ar-lath</i>, moist place, on account of its marshes.... It is sufficiently
evident that the name Arelate has not a physiognomy either Greek or
Roman; and the radical <i>Ar</i> which is found ... in the name of the
Arekomique Volcians ... the Arnnematici, the Arandunici ...
permits one to affirm that this city was contemporary with those
ancient peoples, and existed in the fifth century before our era....
Placed between its river and its inland sea, Arles had in fact two
ports as she had two cities: on the left bank of the Rhone was the
Patrician town, with its temples, its amphitheatre, its theatre, its
forum, the baths, triumphal arches, statues.... On the right bank
... was the city of business men, sailors, and the people. Larger
in those days than the Patrician city, <i>Trinquetailles</i> is nothing to-day
but the maritime suburb of the modern town. A bridge of boats
connected the two towns, and Constantine substituted for it a bridge
of masonry of which one can still see the remains on the quays of
the Rhone."

CHAPTER X
</p>
<p class="center">
ARLES
</p>

<p>
A few more turns of the kaleidoscope of life, and we find
ourselves sitting in a Roman amphitheatre among a crowd
of spectators.
</p>

<p>
That odious descendant of the Roman games, the bullfight,
does, at certain times, carry on in a far milder form
the ancient tale of agony in this very arena, but the
present performance given by a troup of Laplanders is of
quite another character.
</p>

<p>
The people of Arles had come in considerable crowds to
see them, but what interested us was the spectators, not
the Laplanders. It was Sunday, and many of the
women had on their famous costume: a black skirt,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
white muslin or tarlatan fichu, a picturesque white cap
with a band of embossed black velvet round it, which
hangs gracefully at one side. The Arlésiennes are
beautiful, and carry themselves perfectly.
</p>

<p>
A picturesque costume is popularly said to "make
people look handsome;" as if the dress created a beauty
that was not really there!
</p>

<p>
At Arles, by comparing the faces of those who wear the
costume with those who have abandoned it for modern
garb, one can clearly realise that beauty&mdash;which consists
in relations of line and tint&mdash;is not <i>made</i> but <i>revealed</i> by
its setting. One sees, too, how, on the other hand, it can,
by the same means, be disguised and hidden, just as it
would be easy to disguise the symmetry of some fine
freehand design by tacking on to its outline a random
selection of octahedrons or oblate spheroids. This, be
it added, is too often the sort of process pursued by the
designer of modern costume.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of the Arlésiennes is attributed to their
Greek descent from the original founders of the city.
Judging by appearance, one would say there was a strong
touch of Saracen blood mingling with the clearer current
of the classic.
</p>

<p>
The hair is generally black, the eyes dark, the features
regular and often noble in character.
</p>

<p>
Arles is a place of narrow streets, of ruins, of tombs.
It stands in a wilderness of vast lagoons at the mouths of
the Rhone, and in ancient times it could only be reached
by water, for the land was all covered with these meres
to the foot of the Alpilles. In the time of the Romans
and during the Middle Ages these great waters were
navigated by the <i>utriculares</i>, or raftsmen, whose flat
craft were made of extended skins.
</p>

<p>
Merchandise from Central Gaul had to come to Arles to
be transshipped on its way to the East or elsewhere, <i>viâ</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
the Mediterranean. The raftsmen carried it over the
shallow water round the city, and plied a roaring local
trade as well.
</p>

<p>
At Arles all interested in architecture will be apt to
linger before the very remarkable church of St.
Trophime.
</p>

<p>
The interest lies in the characteristic Provençal blending
of the pure Roman style with its offshoot, the
Romanesque, an architecture which forms a curious
analogue to the Romance languages, formed during the
same period when things Roman were falling to pieces,
yet were still the only standards and models, the type of
all possible achievements in human life and art.
</p>

<p>
The Romanesque is the <i>patois</i> of the classic architecture
(with a history singularly analogous to that of the
language), developing finally into the eloquent Gothic of
our great cathedrals. But it was in the north, not in the
south&mdash;just as in the language&mdash;that the more evolved
form established itself. That leaves to the southern
speech and architecture a primitive charm all their own.
</p>

<p>
Of the porch of St. Trophime the engaged pillars are
classic as to their capitals, Romanesque in the half barbaric
carving of their bases. The figures in the niches
formed by the pillars are Roman in general type, yet with
a touch of Byzantine, which may be described as the
architectural Romance dialect of the East.
</p>

<p>
The interior was a surprise. The half-barbaric richness
of the porch had disappeared. The choir had something
of the northern Gothic, but the nave was severe,
and indeed rigid in character, yet with none of the massiveness
that makes the Norman version of Romanesque
so fine. In another country one would have concluded
that the interior was of earlier date than the highly
decorated porch; but in Provence this rigid manner
belongs to the second period of architecture, when the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
Cistercians&mdash;afraid, apparently, lest imaginative decoration
might make things too pleasant and beautiful for
sinful mortals&mdash;introduced a new style in which such
irrelevancies were sternly banished: hence even the piers
of the nave are merely square blocks of masonry. One
must hope that the worshippers of St. Trophime received
commensurate spiritual benefit for the deprivation thus
imposed upon them.
</p>

<p>
The church gives one a sense of chill, of hardness; an
atmosphere from which all the inspiration and intuition
of religious feeling has been driven out, and only the
intolerance and cold-blooded pieties remain.
</p>

<p>
It is exceedingly interesting none the less, for it is so
fine an example of the emotionless Cistercian style of the
twelfth century&mdash;the twelfth century, strange to relate,
when the troubadours were singing their loudest and best,
when the great castles were overflowing with gaiety, and
all the land was full of dance and song.
</p>

<p>
The cloisters belong to the earlier and richer period,
the pillars being carved with real Romanesque beasts and
birds of the most aggrieved and untamed character, with
vigorous foliage and volutes, and every variety of ornament;
yet all balanced with that perfect instinct of the
mediæval carver, never afraid to let himself go, to plunge
into a profusion almost riotous, while always some sane
inner guidance builds up the richness into a beautiful
whole, wherein the quality of reserve which seemed so
recklessly broken down in the spendthrift detail reappears
as by miracle to bind all into one. There is
no lack of emotion here. It informs every rampant
beast and indignant bird, every living curve of leaf and
swirl of volute; but it is like the clamour of tumultuous
music, all welded together into harmony.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In this city of the lagoons there are endless associations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
of Roman days and of days far earlier, as well as tangible
relics of those dim ages that, at best, remain so profound
a mystery even to the most learned. Of the Greek colony
a few marbles remain, and a few words. The Provençal
herdsmen in the mountains call their bread <i>arto</i>, from
the Greek <span lang='greek'>αρτος</span>. The sea also is <i>pelagre</i> (<span lang='greek'>πελαγος</span>), and
there are a few more as obviously or more indirectly
derived.
</p>

<p>
It was to Arles, among other Provençal places, that
St. Martha came to convert the people to Christianity.
With a little company of saints, she arrived one day in
the gay pagan city just when they were all celebrating
the festival of Venus. And forthwith St. Trophimus&mdash;the
beloved friend of St. Paul&mdash;lifted up his voice and
addressed the laughing, dancing crowd, and suddenly,
with a great crash, the statue of the goddess fell to the
earth, and the people were converted. Encouraged by
this rapid discomfiture of one of the most powerful of the
Olympians, the little band dispersed through the country&mdash;St.
Eutropius to Orange, St. Saturnin to Toulouse, and
St. Martha to Tarascon to reform the Tarasque, with
what success we shall presently know.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was because the weather had lost its
brilliance that Arles seemed to us a little sad. Its beautiful,
poplar-bordered Aliscamps, the famous avenue of
tombs, was scarcely a cheering place to loiter in at the
close of a winter afternoon. It brought home too clearly
the Roman idea of death: sombre, cold, grim, merciless.
Sometimes, not very often, the tombs revealed regret for
the dead that appeared more than conventional; sometimes
one seemed to discern, breathing out of the damp-stained
marble, a passion of grief that was unbearably
hopeless; human love beating, beating for ever, with
bleeding hands, against a hateful, unyielding doorway.
One had to hurry past those tombs....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-168" id="i-168"></a>
<img src="images/i-168.jpg" width="253" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LES ALISCAMPS, ARLES.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By Joseph Pennell.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
This avenue is the sole remains of what was once a
very large Roman cemetery, destroyed when the railway
came to the city. Among the tombs was found one
of Julia, daughter of Lucius Tyrannus, proudly representing
in sculpture all the musical instruments on which
she could play, among them an organ, said to be the
earliest example known. Marble sarcophagi are ranged
in rows beneath the poplars, leading the eye along the
solemn glade to the church of St. Honorat, another
fine example of Provençal Romanesque, with a bell
tower built on lines almost purely Roman.
</p>

<p>
St. Virgilius, under whose direction it was erected, had
no little trouble at the beginning of his work. The
pillars of the church had arrived, and were just going
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
to be set up, when the workmen found that they could
not get them lifted, do what they would. The reason
was obvious. They found sitting solidly on the columns
a very small but very determined demon, and budge he
would not. He sat there square and firm, resolved that
the obnoxious church should never be completed if he
had any say in the matter. At last, in despair, they had
to send for St. Virgilius, who was Bishop of Arles, and
with holy-water and various exorcisms the obstructive
demon was driven away and the columns triumphantly
hoisted into their places, where one can see them to this
day. It seemed to us that that demon had not altogether
departed from the church. The place was gloomy, uncanny,
damp, and unwholesome, but undoubtedly a fine
example of its style.
</p>

<p>
St. Virgilius, no doubt on account of his saintship, was
much beset by demons and false appearances&mdash;a very
discouraging feature in the lives of the saints.
</p>

<p>
He was one night looking out over the lagoons, when
he saw a phantom ship, and a voice called out saying
that the crew was bound for Jerusalem and had come to
take St. Virgilius with them. But the wary saint replied,
"No, thank you; not until I know who you are!" And
he made the sign of the cross, and instantly the ship
became a drift of mist, and rolled away across the water.
</p>

<p>
This is said to be a version of the legend of the
"Flying Dutchman."
</p>

<p>
It is not surprising that Arles should have had so
many splendid Roman buildings, for not only did it
become a Roman colony,<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> but it was the residence
of Roman emperors, and was nicknamed the Rome of
Gaul&mdash;<i>Gallula Roma, Arelas</i>.
</p>

<p>
The museum was rich in relics of the Imperial occupation.
There is a beautiful bust of the Empress Livia
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
among the treasures, and one exquisite little head of a
boy, son of one of the Cæsars, a delicate, pathetic little
face, evidently an individual, not a type.
</p>

<p>
The collection also boasts a Phœnician tomb which
looks as if it were made yesterday, and some fine reliefs
of dancing figures, decorated foliage, instinct with that
quality of beauty, lightness, magic that the Gods have
bestowed upon the art of Greece. This quality comes
into strong evidence in this museum, where there are
Pagan and Christian sarcophagi side by side in large
numbers. Fine as are the earlier Christian sculptures
(that is, on tombs before the withdrawal of protection from
Christian cemeteries),<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> they are not to be compared with
the pure pagan work; and the later tombs of Christian
origin are "rude and childish in design and execution."
</p>

<p>
One can spend hours wandering about the nooks and
corners of the city, loitering by the river-side, where
there are the wretched remains, worse than ruined, of a
palace of Constantine; lingering about the silent theatre
where the famous Venus of Arles was found.
</p>

<p>
Cyril, an enthusiastic deacon, had the building destroyed,
knocked down all the statues and all the noble
pillars, of which only two sad ones are now standing
above the ruin.
</p>

<p>
One might sit for hours unmolested on some fragment
of the seats once so gaily filled with fashionable citizens
of the Empire, for though the ruins are surrounded by
houses on three sides there is little sign of life in those
quiet and ancient dwellings of the citizens of Arles. The
fine tower of St. Trophime rises conspicuously behind
them, a true southern tower, square and solid, with the
three stories marked with flat arcading and round-topped
windows: simple, characteristic, with a grave charm
which is almost impossible to define, yet very obvious.

The parapet dividing the auditorium from the stage
is still standing here and there, and from this the
two columns rise into the air, supporting even yet a
fragment of the entablature on their ornate capitals.
</p>

<p>
Cyril, the iconoclastic deacon, had the place smashed
up in indignation at the levity of the performance.
</p>

<p>
There is little levity now at any rate to trouble any
deacon, however serious! One feels, looking at the
desolation, and listening to the silence&mdash;for it is a silence
that throbs and cries more loudly than ever the audience
applauded in days gone by&mdash;one feels as if the good Cyril
need hardly have troubled himself to interfere so stormily
with the doings of the people. He could not stamp out
"human levity" by knocking down fine columns and
statues. He might stamp out human happiness and the
sense of the beautiful, perhaps, and help to make a
coarser, duller race to inhabit the earth. But happily
the "levity" must survive in some form or other,
devastate our deacons never so wisely!

CHAPTER XI
</p>

<p class="center">SONG, DANCE, AND LEGEND
</p>

<p>
There are so many famous things connected with Provence
that one never comes to the end of them. There
are dances and festivals and fires on St. John's Eve in
honour of Baal (as there are, or were till quite lately, in
Scotland). There are rich wines and the far-famed
<i>bouillabaisse</i>, a dish of fish of mixed sorts, boiled with
saffron, and, to feminine palates, extremely nasty!
</p>

<p>
Great was our delight to see, in passing a side-road
leading to a small hostelry, a sign-board with the mystic
word printed in triumphant letters. This was local
colour indeed! Our enthusiasm rose to boiling-point;
I doubt if even our critical friend could have chilled us
at that moment.
</p>

<p>
Here was Provence and <i>bouillabaisse</i>; nothing disappointing;
the concoction not one whit less nauseous
than one might have expected!
</p>

<p>
Dumas writes with ardour about the dish:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"While polenta and macaroni possess all the characteristics of
primitive and antediluvian simplicity, <i>bouillabaisse</i> is the result
of the most advanced state of culinary civilisation; comprising in
itself a whole epic of unexpected episodes and extraordinary
incidents."
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The celebrated wines of Chateauneuf-des-Papes, Sainte
Baume, and others I doubt if we tasted; but all the
wines seemed ambrosial to us; especially when it was
"weather for singing the Peyrenolle," a very ancient
song of which only the name remains in this saying of
the people.
</p>

<p>
The dance of the <i>farandole</i> is of Greek origin and
must be infinitely graceful, but alas! we only heard of
it, never saw it danced. The dancers join hands to form
chains, each chain led by a man or a woman, who plays
a merry air on the <i>gaboulet</i>. These chains, following
their leaders, then form into lines, passing rapidly
before one another in contrary directions&mdash;like divergent
currents&mdash;dancing in time to the music. And then they
swing off into circles and dance round and round maypoles
and walnut-trees, till the whole place is wild with
merriment. On occasions of great rejoicing the people
used to dance the <i>farandole</i> through the streets, all
joining in the whirling circles, rich and poor. It was
like a wind of joy flying through the city!
</p>

<p>
The people of Provence have also some Saracen dances,
bequeathed to them by that marauding people when they
lived in the Mountains of the Moors, in their rock-set
fortresses: <i>Li Mouresco</i> and <i>lis Ouliveto</i>, which was
danced after the olive harvest.
</p>

<p>
This pervasive characteristic of dance and song for
which Provence is so famous, doubtless springs from the
fact that this people have never ceased to be pagans.
</p>

<p>
The clergy of the Middle Ages in vain tried to suppress
this element. There are strange stories of the mingling
of ancient customs and diversions with Christian ceremonies:
dancing and songs, the antique chorus, and
love-poems sung or recited in the very churches;
ecclesiastical discipline being far less stringent in the
south than in the north of France, where classic influences
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
had been weaker. Religion was associated in
the minds of the Provençals with gaiety and festivals;
and the clergy, in order to attract and retain the people,
had found it necessary to recognise this pagan spirit
which took its origin in far-off generations when the
Greeks founded Marseilles and its numerous off-shoots;
when for five and a half centuries the Romans ruled and
civilised the country. In the ninth and tenth centuries,
moreover, the clergy and the people of the south were
more or less closely assimilated, and this touch of
paganism in the priesthood made possible what at first
sight challenges belief.
</p>

<p>
At Limoges, for instance, during the feast of St. Martial,
the people used to substitute for the words of the Latin
liturgy some original couplets in the Romance tongue:
"St. Martial, pray for us, and we will dance for you,"
and they furthermore broke out into a dance in the
church, without the faintest sense of incongruity; for to
these people worship, song, and rhythmic movement
were parts of one and the same impulse.
</p>

<p>
And&mdash;if one comes to that&mdash;on what ground have they
been divorced?
</p>

<p>
The feast of Flora was celebrated in Provence till the
sixteenth century, when it was suppressed; the "mimes"
and actors of antiquity were familiar figures of the
Middle Ages; among them a class of women jongleurs
who went about from city to city; and the wild feast
of the Lupercal is said to have had its mediæval representative
in this essentially pagan land.
</p>

<p>
This was the epoch when Latin had about ceased to be
a living tongue, and from its corpse, so to speak, had
arisen a multitude of dialects all over the Roman world,
among them the Romance or Provençal, the <i>Langue
d'Oc</i>, in which poems and legends were now written.
Authors at this time were nearly always monks, but they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
treated their subjects with much freedom, as, for instance,
in the <i>Vision of St. Paul</i>,<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> who descends to the Infernal
Regions to visit the "cantons of hell" and to see the
luckless sinners in their misery, each tormented appropriately
according to the nature of their transgression.
The poem was evidently a crude forerunner of the Divine
Comedy.
</p>

<p>
From this popular literature the troubadour poetry of
the next centuries sprang, without, however, extinguishing
its predecessors, which continued to exist side by
side with the new forms of art.
</p>

<p>
That character makes destiny is very clearly evidenced
in Provençal history. This rich, eventful, romantic
story is just what a people renowned for <i>bonté d'esprit</i>,
grace, good looks, poetry, eloquence, sentiment, passion,
must inevitably weave for themselves in the course of
ages. From the time when paleolithic man was making
rude stone implements and living in caves or holes in
the earth, this country has been busily forming and
developing the human body and soul, perhaps in a more
clear and visible sequence of progress that can easily be
traced elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The variety and persistence of ancient legends and
customs serves to indicate the road of evolution from
stage to stage with picturesque vividness. The prehistoric
is not far off in this land, where Time loses its
illusory quality and seems to assume the character that
all philosophers attribute to it when they speak of the
<i>Eternal Now</i>.
</p>

<p>
The mountains contiguous to the mountains of the
Moors, the beautiful Esterelles, so familiar to visitors on
the Riviera, have a legend of a fairy Estelle, or Esterella,
who used to be worshipped there and to receive sacrifices.
The woodcutters dread the apparition. Her smile is of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
such unearthly beauty that any man who sees her is so
fascinated that he is for ever drawn by a resistless longing
to find her again, and some "have spent years leaping
from crag to crag, while others have wandered away to
lead the life of a hermit in forest shades." Is this a
myth typifying the search after the Ideal and the
Beautiful?

One day a mysterious man appeared and began to
build a <i>cabanoun</i>, or hut, in a lonely spot. He wore a
sheepskin, red turban, and blue sash; and when a woodcutter
spoke to him he laughed mockingly and cried:&mdash;
</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>
Whereupon an enormous black spider came swinging
from the branch of a pine, with menacing looks. The
woodcutter said it was as large as a <i>tesa-negra</i> (blackhead
or linnet). He flees in horror, but can't resist returning
on the morrow to the mysterious <i>cabanoun</i>. He feels a
shivering feeling creep over him as he approaches, and is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
again greeted by a burst of laughter. "<i>Ha, ha, ha,
mon vieux, toccan li cique sardino ensen</i>" ("Let us touch
the five sardines together, neighbour," <i>i.e.</i>, shake hands&mdash;common
Provençal expression).
</p>

<p>
and the great spider fixed his eyes on Sieur Guizol, the
woodcutter, and ran nimbly down its silken cord. Then
the strange host comes down from among the rafters and
begins to talk. Finally, he tells his guest that he has
come to seek the <i>Cabro d'Or</i>, and breaks out again in
a wild song&mdash;"Taragnigna, you and I are going to make
our fortunes."
</p>

</div>
</div></div>

<p>
And the spider seemed to dance in a wild ecstasy,
vibrating on his line with immense impetus, quite close
to Sieur Guizol's face.
</p>

<p>
Then Guizol asks if his host really believes in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
Golden Goat, and the man addresses the spider
indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! dost thou hear him Taragnigna? He doubts
that the <i>Cabro d'Or</i> lives here! But he won't doubt
when he gets some of his gold!"
</p>

<p>
And then he goes on to say that after that he will
marry Guizol's daughter, Rosette, and they will all go
down to the woodcutter's home, and the spider shall
dance Li Mouresco every night.
</p>

<p>
"And thou shall give us <i>lis Ouliveto</i>," he adds, addressing
the formidable insect; "for the Sieur does not know
perhaps that I am a <i>cornamousaire</i>."
</p>

<p>
He draws out a bagpipe and commences to play.
</p>

<p>
"What, <i>brave ome!</i> art thou going to dance? Now
let me see if you have forgotten the farandole," and the
musician lilted up a wild fantastic tune, "and Sieur
Guizol's feet began to keep time to the music, and anon
faster and faster as the player played, faster and faster
poor Guizol danced, while the spider swung about as
though in rapture."
</p>

<p>
Thus the poor woodcutter is drawn under the will of
the recluse and his spider, and night after night, against
his better judgment, against his wish, he goes to meet
the sorcerer at the hole in the mountain where the
Golden Goat guards his treasure.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Guizol is set to work to excavate, the other watching
and holding aloft two pine-torches. Fortunately for
Guizol, Gastoun, the lover of Rosette, had followed him
one night, wondering uneasily at his regular absences
from home. Suddenly the gold-seeker leaps up, seeing
a flag of stone.
</p>

<p>
"The treasure!" he yells. There is not a moment
to lose, for if they do not get the gold before the goat
awakes, the chance is over.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thou dear little <i>bletta oulivié</i>" (olive rod used for
gold finding), "thou didst not deceive me after all," the
man shouts, pouncing on a vase and other buried objects.
They begin to find the gold, when the sorcerer suddenly
takes an iron bar and knocks down his companion and
thrusts him into the hole crying, "Gold, gold, all mine
now!"
</p>

<p>
But Gastoun rushes in and the two engage in a death-wrestle
in the pitch darkness.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Lo cabro d'or, lo dian!</i>" screams the man and rushes
away past his foe, who is dressed in a goat-skin; and so
finally the story ends happily with the rescue of the
stunned Guizol and the betrothal of Gastoun and
Rosette.
</p>

<p>
When Gastoun afterwards visited the <i>cabanoun</i> of the
recluse, he found it all burnt and a blackened skull lying
among the stones. "A rustling sound was heard and a
huge black spider ran hastily across the stones and
climbed on the dead man's skull," fixing its eyes on the
intruder. Then it shot out its line and wafted itself to
the few half-burnt rafters, "and there it swung round
and round in a perfect gavotte." And for many a day
after, as it was rumoured in the mountains, there were
strange sounds at nightfall from the ruined <i>cabanoun</i>,
and the peasants said they heard the drone and cry of the
<i>cornemuse</i> and saw a skeleton seated on a stone playing a
horrible dance.
</p>

<p>
This story&mdash;founded on a legend that is said to exist in
some form or other all over the world&mdash;affords a quick
picture of the place and the people; but it is further
remarkable as a story which seems founded on some case
of mesmeric power, probably by no means uncommon
among these mountaineers, a Celtic people, it is said,
and perhaps for that reason especially sensitive to this
mysterious force.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There is a version of the legend at Nice in which the
treasure-chamber is under the bed of the Paglion. On a
round table a life-sized gold goat and kid are watched
over by an exemplary demon who takes only an hour's
sleep out of the twenty-four. If a bold adventurer can
then creep in and blow the golden trumpet that the
demon is so ill-advised as to keep handy for the purpose
at his side, that imprudent spirit is forced to remain fixed
to the chair, while a swarm of little goblins come trooping
in to offer their services in carrying the treasure to
any spot that the seeker may decide.
</p>

<p>
The entrance to this treasure-chamber is the house of
a magician between the Tina dei Pagani (the Pagan's
Wine-vat, or Roman amphitheatre) and the temple of
Apollo, at Cimiez. The district is somewhat haunted by
demons and the sort of society that they frequent. The
Witches' Rock, rising high beyond Mont Chauve in
inaccessible crags, was dear to the uncanny crew, and it
was here they danced their "unearthly reels."
</p>

<p>
On the Rocca di Dom at Avignon witches and wizards
(<i>masc</i> and <i>masco</i>) used to assemble in the far-off days
when there were only a few windmills built upon the rock.
</p>

<p>
The story of the Hunchback of the Rocca di Dom is
told of other places also, but it seems to suit this spot
better than any. Duncan Craig gives a picturesque
version of it.
</p>

<p>
The hunchback wandered up one night when the
mistral was thundering over the hill, setting the sails of
the windmills tearing madly round. And the moonlight
was shining on the rock, calm through all the tumult.
The man can have had no tendency to insomnia, for he
fell fast asleep in the uproar, and when he woke it was to
sounds of barbaric music and the clashing of cymbals.
And presently La Rocca was alive with a crowd of faces,
high-crowned conical hats, black satins and silks; and to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
the great scandalisation of the watcher, grave and
respected citizens of Avignon arm-in-arm with the
witches. And they were all dancing as hard as they
could dance, and the dust raised by the mistral whirled
with them, and the windmill sails tore round scrooping
and creaking. New arrivals would come on the scene,
and these would receive strange salutations.
</p>

<p>
"Bon Vèspre, Cousin Chin!" ("Good evening, cousin
dog.") "Bono sero, Cousin Cat!" "Bono niue, Coumpaire
Loup!" ("Good-night, gossip Wolf.") "Coume
vai, Misè Limace?" ("How are you, Mistress Snail?")
"Pas maw, pas maw, Cousin Jano."
</p>

<p>
And so they danced to their Saracenic music, and presently
they began to sing together a curious doggerel:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dilun, Dimars e Demecre tres! Dilun, Dimars e
Demecre tres!" ("Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,
three.") And they sang it over and over and over again.
</p>

<p>
At last this seems to have got upon the poor man's
nerves, for suddenly he starts up and shouts&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dijou, Divendre, e Dissate, sieis." ("Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday, six.")
</p>

<p>
"Oh, lou brave gibous!" shriek the witches in chorus.
"The dear hunchback has come up here to complete our
verse for us; Zou, we will make a man of him."
</p>

<p>
And they come towards him in a whirling circle,
dancing round and round him till he is dazed and dazzled
and seems to lose consciousness, when suddenly he finds
himself breathless on the rock alone and&mdash;straight as a
pine!
</p>

<p>
Another hunchback, hearing of this strange cure, went
up to La Rocca on a night of storm, all ready to finish the
witches' rhyme for them. This time it was:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">

<p>"Dilun, Dimars, e Demecre tres,</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"E Dimenche, set," cried the hunchback, with enthusiasm.
Whereupon there was an awful howl and a great
shudder that convulsed all the wicked crew.
</p>

<p>
"Who dares to speak of the Holy Day in these our
revels?" a voice asked.
</p>

<p>
"Es lou gibous, lou marrit gibous! Zou, la gibo, la
gibo. Gibo davans, gibo darriè!"
</p>

<p>
And the luckless man found that, so far from being
cured, he was now doubly deformed&mdash;the old hump on
the back and a new one on the chest&mdash;through the
malicious sorcery of the witches of La Rocca.

them characteristic; most of them inexpressibly charming.
Perhaps the best known is Magali, a quaint and

the love of her adorer, who declares he will follow her

It is most singular what an effect of song there is everywhere
in this country. The rivers seem to sing as they
flow; the tall yellow reeds sing as the wind stirs them;
the olives have a little whispered canzo of their own, and
the mistral&mdash;even he roars a sort of rough baritone in the
general concert. No wonder the troubadours were born
in this most lyrical of lands.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They had songs for every possible occasion: the morning
song or <i>aubade</i>, the <i>serena</i> or evening song, the <i>canzo</i>
or love-song, the <i>tenso</i> for argumentative moods, the
<i>descort</i> when reproaching a cruel lady, the complicated
<i>sestina</i> for moments of unbridled literary energy, the
<i>sirvente</i> for general expression of views, the <i>planh</i> or
complaint, for laments, as, for example, when Folquet of
Marseilles (whose acquaintance we are to make presently)
writes of the death of Count Barral, Viscount of
Marseilles.<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a>

"Like one who is so sad that he has lost the sense of sorrow, I
feel no pain or sadness; all is buried in forgetfulness. For my loss
is so overpowering that my heart cannot conceive it, nor can any
man understand its greatness."
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the following translation of some extracts from a
tenso, the troubadours Bernart de Ventadour and Peirol
discuss relations of personal feeling and artistic creation:
</p>

<p>
<i>Peirol.</i> Little worth is the song that does not come
from the heart, and as love has left me, I have left song
and dalliance.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bernart.</i> Peirol, you commit great folly, if you leave off
those for such a reason; if I had harboured wrath in my
heart, I should have been dead a year ago, for I also can
find no love nor mercy. But for all that I do not
abandon singing, for there is no need of my losing two
things.
</p>

<p>
And so they go on sharpening their wits in gay debate.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Ballada</i> is the merriest and most joyous of all
these songs. It is a dance-song of the people dating from
Greek times. It is sung and danced by one person only,
and seems to be a sort of outburst of individual joy and
delight in life. Its secret is said to lie in the "rhythm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
and graceful waving motion, in conjunction with the
musical accent"; the effect, says Hueffer, "must have
been of surpassing charm."

CHAPTER XII
</p>

<p class="center">TARASCON
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have found a very interesting book," said
Barbara, with an amused smile, to which I had grown
accustomed.
</p>

<p>
"You have been poring over it for half an hour. I
suppose it's poetry," Barbara went on, with philosophical
but not at all disdainful aloofness from that particular
form of human aberration.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;o; not conventionally speaking, poetry."
</p>

<p>
In truth it was the local time-table.
</p>

<p>
But it was poetry after all. Consider the list of
names: Avignon, Tarascon, Beaucaire, Arles, Nimes,
Montpellier, Béziers, Carcassonne, Albi, Aigues Mortes,
Carpentras, Cabestaing, Uzès, Vaucluse, L'Isle sur
Sorgue, Aix-en-Provence&mdash;all printed irreverently in
heartless columns, as if they were not worth mentioning
except for their relation to time and tide.
</p>

<p>
"Now which of all these desecrated shrines of history
shall we go to?"
</p>

<p>
Barbara said they were one and all Greek to her at
present, and she would be happy with any of them.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose we just drift along this line&mdash;this bejewelled
line&mdash;and let things happen to the south-east, with only
a few tooth-brushes in a hand-bag?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Barbara was perfectly willing, but said she <i>must</i> take
a night-gown and a comb as well.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It was a glorious morning when the train puffed out
of the station at Avignon and took a sharp swerve in
order to give us a fine last view of that "little city of
colossal aspect," as Victor Hugo calls it. Always that
dominating palace on the height stretching long and
massive across the hillside. The high mountains to the
south-east stood entrancingly blue, Mont Ventoux
looking as heavenly and innocent as if the bare thought
of harbouring&mdash;much more of deliberately producing a
mistral were a baseness of which she was utterly incapable.
She would hesitate at so much as a stiff breeze!
Yet we had caught her in the act but yesterday and
had left behind in our boxes damning proof of her
guilt in the remnants of two once quite respectable hats
which her <i>protégé</i> had playfully divided into segments as
we crossed the street to post our letters.
</p>

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
"Let us go to Tarascon!"
</p>

<p>
Barbara jumped at it, and we centred our hopes and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
imaginings on that most Provençal of Provençal cities
as the train puffed along on its leisurely way.
</p>

<p>
The towers of Chateau Renard in the middle distance
have a romantic, mysterious effect, standing as they do
on a rocky little hill just far enough away to look
strangely mysterious, with the soft bloom of the spaces
and the peaked ranges behind it. The station of Barbentane
is on the line, but we did not succeed in making
out the village on the hill-top.
</p>

<p>
Ardouin-Dumazet writes:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Les cultures enveloppent jusqu'au Rhone le petit
massif sur lequel se dresse la haute Tour de Barbentane."
</p>

<p>
This gives one at once the character of the country.
Further on we come to La Montagnette de Tarascon,
which "contrasts its bare slopes with the opulent
plain. It is like an island rising out of verdure&mdash;the
white calcined rock takes in an amusing fashion, the
airs of a chain of rocky mountains. The Montagnette
is a miniature of the Alpilles, those miniature Alps."
</p>

<p>
The Alpilles&mdash;strange little knobbly mountains&mdash;grow
into greater prominence as we move eastward and the
outline shows itself more than ever eccentric and
altogether out of fashion, as one imagines fashion
among mountains.
</p>

<p>
They have a style of their own, a marked personality
that is very fascinating. They were yet to explore, with
their memories of the campaign of Marius, their Courts
of Love, their rock-hewn city of Les Baux, their Trou
d'Enfer, their haunts of the famous witch Tavèn and
her demon-companies. We had half a mind to divert
from our route at once and take the little local train
up into the heart of the range, but not liking to think
ourselves lacking in decision of character, we nailed our
colours to the mast, and resolved to see Tarascon
first.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The famous town lies charmingly on the river-side;
a mass of roofs and towers, with its castle of King
René&mdash;that most delightful and lively of monarchs; a
real drawing-master castle, absurdly picturesque, with
two vast round machicolated towers (very troublesome
to shade), and a frowning entrance between them.
(Surely all drawing-masters have taken this castle as
their model since time began!) On the landward side
is a dry moat and a stretch of grass and weeds (the
weeds worked in with a sharp professional touch in
the foreground). Just across the Rhone the vast bridge,
which Tartarin thought too long and slender, leads to
the town and high up on the hill, proud and desolate,
the rival castle of Beaucaire.
</p>

<p>
"Embarras de Beaucaire!"
</p>

<p>
Ardouin-Dumazet says that in his childhood his family
had a neighbour, a good woman, whose exclamation
on the smallest obstacle was invariably "Embarras de
Beaucaire!" And that, he adds, "gave us a grand
idea of the encumbered state of this famous town."
</p>

<p>
"Si vous aviez vu Beaucaire pendant la foire!"
</p>

<p>
As we looked across that stupendous bridge, the phrase
brought with it the picture of a mass of booths along
the quay, shipping and flags and merchandise; and
crowds in holiday costumes of every colour, for people
flocked from all countries to buy and sell at the great
fair "celebrated even beyond the Syrian deserts."
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Lougres difformes,</p>
<p>Galéaces énormes,</p>
<p class="i2">Vaisseaux de toutes formes...."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Dumazet records a conversation he had with one old
man who remembered the great fair in his childhood.
</p>

<p>
"Then one should see Beaucaire!"
</p>

<p>
He described the coming of hundreds of ships, carrying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
each a whole stable full of horses for towing up the river
on the return journey; and how the great canal brought
boats from Aigues Mortes and Albi, and the sea brought
Turks, Algerians, Greeks, Italians, Spaniards, with silk,
pearls, figs, and a thousand objects of merchandise. Then
the good people of Beaucaire were inundated with heretics
and pagans. When there were disputes between the
merchants, a tribunal on the spot settled the matter.
All was arranged in departments: silks, wools, cottons,
whole streets of booths devoted to jewellery, spices,
coffee, and so forth. In the evening the company
cooked their dinners between stones on the shores of
the river; "and one shouted and one laughed, and the
physicians and the acrobats and the bear-tamers called
to the crowd with loud cries amid the noise of cymbals
and tambourines. Fine ladies and gentlemen came from
long distances to see all that!"
</p>

<p>
We heave a sigh of regret at the passing away of so
many bright and cheering things, such as fairs and
picturesque shipping, and turn to wander, as the fancy
takes us, about the pleasant streets of Tarascon, visiting
the tomb of St. Martha, but, through misdirection,
missing the Tarasque. However, we knew all about
his very singular personal appearance from descriptions
and drawings. Tarascon is now probably more associated
with Tartarin in our minds than with St. Martha, but it
is a beautiful legend of the gentle saint who by sheer
force of lovingness was able to change the ravaging
Tarasque&mdash;a creature certainly born with no hereditary
turn for polite usages&mdash;into a pleasant, regenerate animal
of gentlemanly manners. Along the bright ways of the
city, as the legend goes, the procession moved: a crowd
of excited people, a beautiful woman with a light playing
round her head, leading by a silken cord the reformed
monster who ambles after her as quietly as if he were a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
pet-lamb: this huge hybrid of a creature, with the body of
an alligator, the legs of a grand-piano, the head of a dragon,
and a "floreat tail" of heraldic design which he flourishes
affably in response to the plaudits of the multitude.
</p>

<p>
And never again did he ravage the country round
Tarascon or carry off so much as a single babe, after St.
Martha had pointed out to him, with her usual sweet
reasonableness, how wrong-headed and how essentially
immoral such conduct had been.
</p>

<p>
It is disappointing to be told by an innovating savant
that this sweet lady was not St. Martha at all, but merely
the Christianised form of the ancient Phœnician goddess
Martis, the patroness of sailors, who had for her symbols
a ship and a dragon. What <i>is</i> one to be allowed to
believe?
</p>

<p>
The Phœnicians, one has to admit, plied a busy trade
along these coasts. Their language has left traces in the
Provençal dialects, and images have been found at Marseilles
of Melkarth and Melita, or Hercules and Venus,
known in the Bible as Baal and Ashtaroth. There has
even been discovered a tariff for sacrifices in the temple
of Baal, giving a list of dues legally established for the
payments of the priests.
</p>

<p>
(Barbara was utterly confounded to find these distinctly
Biblical deities figuring so far from home.)
</p>

<p>
The tariff is a long affair, and goes into all possible
details. But the following extract maybe worth quoting:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"For an entire ox, the ordinary sacrifice, the priests
are to receive 10 shekels. At the sacrifice, in addition,
300 shekels of flesh," and so on.
</p>

<p>
But it does not follow, from all this, that St. Martha
did not subdue the Tarasque. Moreover, Tarasques are
being subdued every day by Marthas not by any means
arrived at saintship. The old legend, be its origin
Christian, Phœnician, Celtic or classic, reads almost like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
a parable by which to convey the old truth that love and
kindness have power to subdue evil which force has failed
to overcome.
</p>

<p>
St. Martha's tomb and shrine are in the church
dedicated to her at Tarascon, and, until lately, there
were yearly processions through the city, in which the
gigantic creature was paraded in triumph, the legs of the
man inside being ingeniously "dissimulated by a band of
stuff."
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"... les porteurs dansent et cabriolent de façon à faire agiter le
queue et a renverser les curieux trop voisins. (Pour queue une
poutre droite.)"
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Tarasque is furious on the second Sunday after
Pentecost. But later, on the day of St. Martha, he
passes, gentle as a lamb, led by a young girl. The man
inside, with his "dissimulated legs," curvets and gambols
amiably. And the people sing the "Lagagdigadeu," a
song invented, it is said, by King René himself, inspired
perhaps by the tumult of the <i>fête</i> passing his castle down
by the Rhone. Or just the swish of the waters as they
sweep past the walls of the donjon might easily set
fancies ringing in a head like King René's, who saw
things as they are, with the song and the radiance in
them.
</p>

<p>
And the people went following the procession, shouting:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Lagagdigadeu!</p>
<p class="i1">La Tarasco!</p>
<p class="i2">Lagagdigadeu</p>
<p class="i3">La Tarasco!</p>
<p class="i4">De Casteu!</p>
<p class="i5">Laissas la passa,</p>
<p class="i6">La vieio masco!</p>
<p class="i7">Laissas la passa&mdash;</p>
<p class="i8">Che vai dansa...."</p>
</div>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And the Tarasque wags his tail (a straight beam, be it
remembered) and overturns some of the crowd. And the
people are delighted with the prowess of their beast. If
one is injured they cry:
</p>

<p>
"A qua ben fe, la tarascoa rou un bré" ("Well done,
the tarasque has broken his arm").
</p>

<p>
And the clumsy procession moves away and the crowds
sing and shout: "Voulen mai nostro tarasco" ("We wish
again for our tarasque"). And so they let off any amount
of superfluous energy.
</p>

<p>
It is a subject for reflection among sociologists whether
the dying out of pageants and dancing, festivals of harvest
and seed-time&mdash;all the natural expressions of human joy&mdash;does
not constitute a serious danger to the modern state.
For either that joy will find some less healthy kind of
expression or it will be killed altogether; and in that case
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
the race, as a race, must be killed also, as a flower
deprived of the sunshine and the airs of heaven. It is
not joy, but the lack of it that drives a nation mad!
</p>

<p>
So much for Puritanism!
</p>

<p>
No one can be in the South, above all in Provence,
knowing of its ancient festivals, its music, its farandoles
and Saracenic dances, and fail to be startled into new
realisation of this element that has passed out of our life,
the menace that lies in the pervading dullness, that
benumbed worship of sorrow, of "work" and "duty"
without understanding and without freshness, that absence
of fantasy and outcry that binds the modern world in a
terrible and unnatural silence. Of what avail is it that
the people are law-abiding at the cost of the very spring
and essence of being? There is a Nemesis that follows
this sort of virtue: and it visits the virtues of the fathers
upon the children for many a hapless generation. There
is a curious example of this in the experience of the
Society of Friends who took upon themselves to banish
colour and music from their lives, for righteousness' sake,
and have now succeeded&mdash;according to the testimony of
one of their number&mdash;in also destroying all response to
those artistic appeals, so that whole realms of being are
shut off from the children of a race that was afraid to
accept their complete inheritance as human beings. It
is to be hoped that the heart too has been atrophied, for
it is difficult to imagine a hotter hell than that must be
for a man or woman capable of the full tide of emotional
life and yet unable to find expression for it in heaven or
earth!
</p>

<p>
For the vast majority of mankind there are now no
recurrent pleasures worthy of the name, no balance to
the dead weight of mere toil and <i>ennui</i>, no taste of that
mysterious magnetism that dwells in throngs bent on the
same object, inspired by the same joyous idea. With the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
world of to-day has come a dulling of the aspect of things,
a loss of <i>élan</i> and fire; a perilous deprivation of the
primitive form of artistic outpouring. And it is more
than doubtful whether mankind can exist without it.
Is there indeed any object in trying that dangerous
experiment?
</p>

<p>
Why are the majority of moralists, who are so much
concerned for the "good of humanity," so terrified at the
sight of humanity a little happy and spontaneous?
</p>

<p class="p2">
It is at Tarascon, for some unknown Provençal reason,
that the famous Arles sausages are made. We wondered
if the accomplished city also provided Arles with its
beautiful women.
</p>

<p>
There is some difficulty in persuading oneself of the
great antiquity of the cheerful, sleepy little town. It looks
indeed by no means new, but the wear and tear seems
rather that of the life of to-day than of centuries ago.
Yet Strabo (says Paul Mariéton) mentions ταραςκον as
much frequented in his time. Moreover, at Beaucaire,
just across the Rhone, there is a quarter called <i>Rouanesse</i>,
which is said to be a corruption of <i>Rhodanusia</i>, an ancient
Greek colony.
</p>

<p>
For some reason or other we happened, in our wanderings,
to return and return again to the place till at last
all strangeness seemed to depart from it. It was
beginning to have for us more or less the aspect that it
probably had for the natives, allowing, of course, always
for the effect upon them of never having seen much
besides the sunny main street and broad square, with
their hotels and homely houses, and the plane-trees
whose thin shade is grateful even on a November morning.
To see a place too much is never to see it at all.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We grew familiar even with the faces of the people as
they came and went along the ample pavement which
sets back the houses pleasantly far from the road.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of this spreading, easy-going, desultory
main street a row of carriages for hire stand waiting
under a few small trees for the chance traveller who
descends to see the sights of Tarascon between trains.
</p>

<p>
"Voulez-vous une voiture, Mesdames, pour voir la
ville? l'Église de Ste. Marthe, le Château du Roi René,
la tarasque, et Beaucaire; tout dans une heure et quart,
ou vingt minutes sans Beaucaire."
</p>

<p>
We made this classic round on our first visit, including
Beaucaire, and a wonderful circlet of picturesque
mediævalism it is; but afterwards we preferred to find
our own way; to wander through the great stone gate on
the left and glance or saunter down dozens of alluring
byways, where one would come upon fine old doors,
carved lintels, canopies, shrines at the street corners,
flowers on the window-sills, the quick perspective of
street line dark against the sky, and everywhere the
sharp lights and shadows of the south.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, indeed, we would take a drive if only to
please the good-natured "<i>Tartarins</i>" who drove the
carriages. Their black eyes and bronzed skin were very
impressive at first, but when the effect of these had
begun to wear off, we realised that close resemblance to
the tenor of an opera did not involve anything dramatic
in type of character. They were quiet, industrious,
polite fellows, earning their meagre living by a somewhat
precarious industry. But of that presently.
</p>

<p>
Our particular Tartarin was somewhat shocked that we
had not yet seen the tarasque, so there was nothing for
it but to set forth in quest of the monster.
</p>

<p>
There is in the museum at Avignon a strange, uncanny
beast carved in stone which is called the tarasque, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
the effigy that is, or used to be, carried round the town
at Tarascon is quite a young and giddy creature, built
of painted wood, and passes its existence during the
intervals of public function in a sort of large stable which
is kept under lock and key.
</p>

<p>
We were driven solemnly through the narrow streets,
till at length the fly drew up and we alighted at a stately
portal, where, after a few moments of waiting, the
custodian appeared with his keys, and then back the
doors scrooped on their hinges.
</p>

<p>
Laughter was out of keeping with the occasion; our
poor <i>cocher</i> would have been cut to the heart, but it
was hard work to behave decorously. Out of an old-Dutch-master
gloom of background loomed forth a
grotesquely terrible monster, whose proper sphere was
certainly the pantomime. Enormous red-rimmed eyes
stared ferociously at the intruders from a round, cat-like
face rayed with bristling white whiskers. There was also
a touch of hippopotamus in the cast of countenance, only
it lacked the sweeter expression of that more philosophic
beast. The creature had evidently had a new coat of
paint&mdash;black with red facings&mdash;for the huge body was
beautifully glossy.
</p>

<p>
"La voilà, la tarasque!" said our coachman, with
pardonable pride.
</p>

<p>
We hesitated in our comments. Barbara, rather from
lack of familiarity with the <i>nuances</i> of the language than
from any want of frankness, murmured something about
"très jolie"; and Tartarin said, "En effet, Madame, mais
on devait la voir quand on fait le tour de la ville au jour
de fête, mais c'est épatant!"
</p>

<p>
"Je le crois bien," I murmured appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
Tartarin suggested that we might like to see the rest of
the animal before leaving, and so we made the round
(he extended far into the depths of his gloomy dwelling),
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
admiring the pose and the noble proportions of the
creature&mdash;rather like an old-fashioned locomotive&mdash;and
the formidable nature of the tail. Then we felt that
without indiscretion we might depart. As we drove off
we caught a last glimpse of that unspeakably ridiculous
beast who stood glaring at nothing in the darkness, silent
and steadily ferocious to the last. Then the great doors
were swung together and the pride of Tarascon was
hidden from our view.
</p>

<p>
One could but laugh, and yet that absurd effigy was
the representative of the beginnings of our history as
a race!
</p>

<p>
The Christian version of the story is of yesterday: the
arrival of the saints on the shores of pagan Gaul and the
conversion of Tarascon to the new faith by St. Martha.
Some trace the legend to Phœnician sources, as has
been already mentioned; more frequently the animal is
regarded as a Celtic deity or demon, and there are stories
of Hercules and a giant named Taras or Tauriskos: the
classic form of the tradition. In any case it belongs to
the Twilight of the Gods, and if one could really trace
the family tree of that mongrel monster to its roots one
would possibly acquire a good deal of knowledge that
would startle archæologists.
</p>

<p>
It was not till late in the fifteenth century, however,
that the <i>fête</i> of the tarasque was instituted by King René,
that most artistic of monarchs, who loved to see his
people gay and happy; so it was somewhat later than the
real troubadour days that our cat-hippopotamus began to
enjoy a sort of established position; which shows that no
one need despair of appreciation if only he will wait long
enough.
</p>

<p>
We visited more than once the shrine of the gentle
conqueror of the tarasque: standing&mdash;it was startling
to remember&mdash;on the very spot where Clovis, King of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
Franks, once stood, when newly converted to Christianity
by his saintly wife Clothilde. The shrine is in a quiet,
half-subterranean chapel in the church of her name. The
tomb is under a low vault and the marble figure of the
saint rests on the big stone slab with joined hands and a
look of deep peace on her beautiful face. Certainly it is
the face of a woman who might win over ravaging
monsters to sweetness and light. Above the tomb is
the inscription:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><i>Solicita non turbima.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>
Broad steps flecked with colour from the stained-glass
window opposite lead down to the dim little crypt where
she sleeps, and one hanging lamp burns in the twilight
and the silence which seems too deep and too far below
the surface of the life of the moment to be disturbed by
the irrelevant steps and voices of visitors, or by the
troops of little girls who come under the care of a nun to
visit the shrine.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The regions down by the Castle of King René are
delightful to loiter in on a warm day. Of vast size and
solidity, this fourteenth-century fortress is full of the
atmosphere of romance. The southern wall plunges
sheer into the Rhone; at right angles to this river front
stretches the mass of the building; tower and barbican
and battlement in splendid array, the dry moat and the
road running alongside.
</p>

<p>
What observant traveller passing at the foot of some
ancient tower has not noticed the magical aspect of
its line of luminous contact with the fields of the
air?

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The immense block of masonry from its roots in the
soil to its battlements in the sky stands clear against the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
mysterious spaces, and presently it seems to stir and lean
forward, as if it might fall or drift away in emulation
of some free-born cloud that swims over its head.
It is delightful to loiter in the road by the moat just
below the hillock that rises to the river-bank and opposite
the last of the towers, which stands at the angle of the
castle between land and water. At this spot nothing can
be seen of hill and river, only the tower and sky. They
meet at the magic line&mdash;inexorable stone and quivering
ether; substance enthralled and infinity in motion!
</p>

<p>
Floods of light from the steady tumult of the waters
are reflected upon the cream-white walls and fill the
whole atmosphere. It seems to tremble against the
tower as one watches. And one knows that more
obviously than usual one stands at the gate of the
Eternal Mystery.
</p>

<p class="p2">
At the top of the hillock the river bursts into view,
incredibly broad, hurrying, joyous, with Beaucaire on its
opposite shore watched over by the ruined keep on the
height: the scene of that most charming of old French
romances, "Aucassin and Nicolette."
</p>

<p>
Just before the eye, a little below King René's Castle,
is the famous bridge; it might be the bridge between
this world and the next, between Good and Evil, between
Heaven and Hell, so long it is. The great whisper of the
tide is audible now to any one who elects to pause here
in the sunshine and listen. There is a little hidden
corner at the angle between the castle and a curtain of
wall that meets it into which the water sweeping along
the castle side is flung and repulsed with a great back-surge,
meeting, as it returns, the edges of the main
current and so falling into an immense conflict,
fascinating to watch with its hundred whirlpools and
hollows, swellings and eddies, and all the babbling and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
complaining of torrents detained in their ever-pressing
errand. One could spend hours on the spot, and in
adventurous moods might yield to the temptation of
walking along the broad ledge of the curtain-wall till one
stood just above the dizzy spot where the waters swing
together and hurl themselves back with anger and
trembling into the great stream.

CHAPTER XIII
</p>

<p class="center">THE PONT DU GARD
</p>

<p>
Barbara had heard of the approaching arrival of some
cherished relations in Provence, and as blood is the
thickest of all substances&mdash;impenetrable by the X or any
other rays&mdash;it was arranged that she should meet them
at an appointed rendezvous and stay with them till the
common fluid that flowed in their veins had been satisfied.
Then she was to return to continue our joint adventures.
</p>

<p>
So one fine day I found myself alone at Tarascon.
It is supposed to be necessary to have some idea of what
one is going to do with oneself in a place before electing
to go there, but this I believe to be a superstition. It is
only necessary to present oneself and destiny will do the
rest.
</p>

<p>
Yet I had seen everything of note in Tarascon, and
Tartarin was evidently concerned about me, for even he
could suggest nothing further. We were discussing
possibilities in a desultory manner when one of his
professional brothers passed at a rattling pace with a
fare evidently just returned from doing Tarascon in the
twenty minutes&mdash;"sans Beaucaire."
</p>

<p>
The inmate of the fly was pale and lank, with colourless
hair. I gave a start&mdash;my critical Englishman of the
Pont du Gard! The hat went off, and I caught, as the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
carriage rolled by, the simple words, "Wretched hole;
not a decent&mdash;&mdash;" but the movement of the fly bereft me
of the end of the sentence.
</p>

<p>
"How far is it to the Pont du Gard?" I asked, with
the swiftness of inspiration.
</p>

<p>
Tartarin's face brightened.
</p>

<p>
"Est-ce que Madame désire d'y aller?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainement."
</p>

<p>
Tartarin rubbed his hands. We could start after the
<i>déjeuner</i> and be back at the Hôtel de la Couronne in the
late afternoon. It was about eighteen kilometres; a fine
long job for Tartarin, who usually had to take his chance
with the many other drivers for quite a short round of
the town. The Pont du Gard being more usually visited
from Nimes, the expedition was a windfall for our friend.
</p>

<p>
So we set off. The carriage would not open, and as
the day was warm with the sun in spite of a cold wind,
it was annoying to be shut into a stuffy little box which
hid from view half the long stretches of country, and
allowed one no time to dwell upon the features of the
farms and villages, for one could look neither back nor
forward. But there were, as a matter of fact, but few
villages, only farms. <i>Mas</i> is the Provençal for a farm, as
any reader of Mistral will soon learn, for the poet is never
tired of dwelling on the simple and, it would seem, exceptionally
happy life that is passed in these homesteads;
the owner a sort of benevolent patriarch directing the
labours of sowing, sheep-shearing, the vintage, the olive
gathering, the treading of the corn, and the harvest. It
is Mistral's own father whom he describes so often with
so much affection and reverence:&mdash;

The carriage soon swallowed the eighteen kilometres of
level road, the country changing in character as we
neared the banks of the Gard. Here began the great cliffs
which had inspired the Romans with the truly Imperial
idea of carrying water to Nimes across the river from height
to height, for with all their engineering skill this great
people did not know that water will rise to its own level.
</p>

<p>
The magnificent bridge came suddenly into view,
startling in its forty-nine metres of solid grandeur.
Three tiers of arches lifted themselves one above the
other; the lowest series short and solid, the second
more slender and taller, rising in its haughty Roman
way to carry the third and most towering of all, at whose
summit in the sky used to run the water which supplied
the people of Nimes when they were Roman citizens.
It was there on hot summer days that they revelled
in their splendid baths (fed by the great aqueduct)
which may still be seen in the public gardens, with
cool open marble courts some eight or ten feet below
the level of the soil, where stone Tritons and Neptunes
kept watch over the waters that flowed refreshingly among
the white columns, and lay green and still in little
murmuring grottoes well sheltered from the sun. It was
then, too, that these luxurious citizens used to assemble
in their thousands to see beasts and men fight for dear
life in the great amphitheatre; and then that some
Roman built the curious Tour Magne that puzzles the
learned and dominates the town to this day. The Pont
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
du Gard must have presented precisely the same aspect
to those old Romans as it does to us, for scarcely a stone
has been disturbed in all these centuries.

<p>
It is not surprising that its magnificent design should
have been attributed in the middle ages to the devil.
</p>

<p>
The story is that the architect, overwhelmed with the
difficulty of the task and the number of times the river
had carried away the uncompleted arches, was almost
thinking of abandoning it altogether, when the enterprising
enemy of mankind approached with the offer to
construct the bridge in such a way as never bridge had
been constructed before, for the trifling consideration of
the first soul that should cross it after its completion.
</p>

<p>
The architect went home to his wife in mingled elation
and despair.
</p>

<p>
The couple had evidently not had traffic with the
devil for nothing, for they hit upon the contemptibly
mean device of thrusting the penalty of their evil
compact upon helpless and innocent shoulders. The
wife suggested that they should set free a hare at one
end of the bridge and let it run across to the devourer of
souls, who was to wait at the other end with an open sack
to catch his prey. And the trick succeeded. When the
poor hare arrived at the fatal end of the bridge the devil,
recognising in a fury how he had been duped, flung the
animal against the wall, where it is said its impress on
the stone can be seen to this day.<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a>
</p>

<p>
The task of the tourist is to cross the river on the topmost
tier of arches, through the disused aqueduct, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
set forth to accomplish this apparently break-neck feat.
It is in reality quite easy. One has but to walk over the
bridge that runs along the lowest tier of arches and then
scramble up the rough hill on the opposite side of the
river. The arches seen thus in sharp perspective are
sublime, and they seem never-ending.
</p>

<p>
On the hillside grow many sweet-smelling aromatic
plants, and they tempt one to linger that one may
bruise the leaves and so enjoy the fresh wholesomeness
of the perfume. Below, at a dizzy distance, runs
the Gard, the shores rich with woods over which now
is a sort of mysterious bloom that seems in perfect
keeping with the unseen Enchanted Castle filled with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
exquisite works of art from all the quarters of the globe,
that hides somewhere among the foliage a little lower
down the stream.
</p>

<p>
Ascending to the level of the aqueduct one sees traces of
its route over the hill on the way to Nimes. To reach it
one must mount a short stair, and then one finds oneself in
an immensely long tunnel, about seven or eight feet high,
roofed in with stone slabs, which, however, are lacking
here and there, so that the passage is dimly lighted.
Along this ruined watercourse I crossed the Gard. It was
like walking through a catacomb open at intervals to the
sky. Here and there through chinks between the slabs,
or in places where they had been broken away, one could
catch glimpses of beautiful reaches of the river.
</p>

<p>
One emerges at the end of the tunnel on to a rough
hillside, covered with shrubs, brambles, shaggy trees, and
masses of ivy, a sort of Salvator Rosa landscape under the
clouded heavens; for the day had changed and a mantle
of grey spread itself over the majestic scene.
</p>

<p>
Scrambling down by chance steep pathways among the
shrubs&mdash;losing my way more than once by following
tracks that led to the edge of some miniature precipice&mdash;I
found myself wondering, in the foolish, insistent way
that one does wonder about trivial things, whether our
tourist friend had managed to feel as disappointed as he
had expected he would be with the Pont du Gard.
</p>

<p>
It looked absolutely sublime as one retreated from it on
the homeward way; its towering arches rearing themselves
tier above tier, like some dauntless human life lived
steadily for a great purpose. And the storms of centuries
have not been able to touch its splendour, though for ever
they assail it&mdash;rain and sun, rain and sun, as the Provençal
children sing&mdash;

CHAPTER XIV
</p>

<p class="center">A HUMAN DOCUMENT
</p>

<p>
The inside of the fly being stuffy and the view impeded
from that position, I decided to make the return journey
from the Pont du Gard on the box. Tartarin was too
philosophic and too polite to show any surprise at this
new form of Britannic madness, so we set off, and the
good <i>cocher</i> proved a most entertaining companion.
</p>

<p>
He had read a great deal in one way and another, and
had developed quite a philosophy of his own, Epicurean
in the true, not the popular sense of the word, strange as
it may appear. Hard experience had wrung it out of
him as wine from the wine-press. He was born at
Tarascon, and had one sister who had also lived in the
city of St. Martha since her birth. The two did not live
together; no, she was a little&mdash;<i>enfin</i>, she had her ways of
living and he had his. He liked his liberty, and she&mdash;well,
she did <i>not</i> like it: <i>his</i> liberty, <i>bien entendu</i>. She
could not support that he should have a key of the house;
she would always sit up for him if he was out in the
evenings, and it was <i>gênant</i>. Not that Tartarin cared to
stay out late, he was quiet in his tastes. "<i>Je ne fais pas
la noce moi</i>," he explained; "<i>c'est vide tout ça; néomoins
il faut que je suis maître de moi-même; quoique je ne le
suis pas</i>," he added with a philosophic shrug and a good-natured
"Ain!" to his horse. He lodged "<i>chez Bottin</i>"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
in the main street with a number of his colleagues.
They were hired to drive the carriages, and if they did
not get many fares the <i>patron</i> reproached them for laziness.
Most of the drivers were eager to make a good
haul, for if they were very unsuccessful the employer
might discharge them. Tartarin's attitude was characteristic.
He made his effort; set forth the attractions of
Tarascon and the Castle of Beaucaire, and calmly awaited
the result. If the visitors took the carriage he was
pleased; if one after another passed him, "<i>Eh! bien, tant
pis</i>"; he hoped for better luck next time. And resolutely
he abstained from adding to the little turn of ill-fortune
the pain of regret.
</p>

<p>
After all, he had "<i>le bon soleil</i>." When it was cold&mdash;and
it <i>can</i> be cold in the Midi&mdash;he needed all his philosophy:
to wait and wait for visitors who never came, to
pass hours and days in the bitter wind, and to have time
to think about life and what it must always be for him!
Yes, there were moments, "<i>Mais que voulez-vous? C'est
la vie.</i>" One thing he was sure of: <i>la vie</i> was always
more or less like that <i>même pour les riches</i> (Oh! deep-visioned
Tartarin!).
</p>

<p>
He had not always lived at Tarascon. When he was a
boy he had been full of ambition. He would make his
fortune and have a merry time of it. He had wandered
far and wide in his own country, seeking fortune and
experience. And he had found experience but not fortune.
Among other adventures, he joined a band of
athletes and used to perform in the streets of Paris, in
tights, with two other youths and a girl in spangles.
She was the daughter of the employer, his first love, "<i>c'est
à dire le premier amour sérieux. Ah! comme elle était
belle!</i>" But he had no luck; she loved another, "<i>un
animal de joueur sur le mandolin</i>." And she would not
look at Tartarin when the gay rival was present.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The rejected one wandered farther afield for fresh
adventures; engaged himself with a travelling theatrical
company, first in the capacity of scene-shifter, but later
he was offered a temporary post as walking-gentleman,
and probably he would have gone far in the profession
but for another amorous complication. The leading-lady
had pleased his fancy and appeared to reciprocate his
sentiments. But one day, in the side-scenes, he discovered
her in a non-professional love episode with the
permanent villain, and after a painful interview, during
which he and the villain came to blows, Tartarin resolved
to leave the perfidious one and the troupe, and throw up
such chances as might there offer themselves. Dispirited
and disillusioned, he returned to his native town, where
he engaged himself to Bottin and earned his little crust of
bread in peace, if not too gaily. He had given up all idea
of marriage, not because he was indifferent to <i>les femmes</i>,
"<i>au contraire</i>," but he did not care to ask a woman to
share so poor a life. "<i>Je suis mieux seul.</i>" As it was,
he had not to reproach himself for bringing another into
the struggle of life.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Et quelque fois on va au marché et on achette des
enfants</i>," he added fantastically, "<i>et alors, que voulez-vous?</i>"
After that the deluge, he seemed to imply.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Je gagne 40 francs</i>," he said, "<i>avec le logement</i>."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Par semaine?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Et mon Dieu non: si c'etait par semaine!</i>" He raised
his eyes to heaven as if he had a vision of beatitude.
"<i>Non, par mois.</i>"
</p>

<p>
That and a few tips given him by his clients was all he
had to live upon.
</p>

<p>
But that did not trouble him, in itself. His fear was of
losing his health and not being able to work. But he put
away black thoughts, and turned his mind to the good
that he possessed. After all, he had his health and his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
livelihood, so where was the profit of thinking of a
possible time when he might lose both? Would that
help him? He had suffered when he was young and full
of ambition; <i>mon Dieu</i>, he had always desired something
he did not possess, and if after great efforts he acquired
what he wanted, always the desire ceased and there was
some new thing that made him restless.
</p>

<p>
"<i>A quoi bon se tourmenter toujours de cette façon?</i>"
</p>

<p>
And so he came to see that all his happiness, if ever he
was to enjoy any, was stored in his own consciousness,
and that nothing from without would avail him, though
it were riches and honours without end.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Néomoins</i>," he added, with a naïve little gesture,
"<i>néomoins</i>, if chance <i>were</i> to make him the possessor of a
little fortune, he would buy a little house&mdash;<i>toute petite</i>,
with a garden; he would have one servant whom he
would treat very well, and he would have a little trap
and horse which he would drive himself. And then he
would envy no man!"
</p>

<p>
After all then a desire still lingered.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ah ça ne me fait pas de mal!</i>" he said with a shrug,
"<i>ç'a m'amuse</i>." "I am not unhappy in knowing it can
never come. <i>Voilà la différence!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Poor Tartarin! And yet in truth was he to be pitied
or envied? He must have seemed somewhat strange to
his comrades. They would get excited and troubled over
all sorts of trivial things, and they would offend one
another and flare up into quarrels. Not so Tartarin.
He would quietly evade points of difference, laugh off
some threatening dispute, make peace between hot-headed
combatants. Such things seemed to him needless,
foolish. "<i>A quoi bon?</i>" as he asked. "<i>Ça ne vaut pas
la peine, mon Dieu!</i>"
</p>

<p>
As we were nearing our destination his confidences
grew more rapid. After all a man who had thought and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
felt about things to this extent must have badly needed a
means of expression at times.
</p>

<p>
One is so apt to imagine that the lives one touches thus
casually are all more or less what one calls "normal."
But when the veil is lifted by some accident, it is not
often the purely normal that one finds below it. When
Tartarin mentioned that he and his sister were born at
Tarascon, I had vaguely pictured an ordinary well-conducted
French family. But I found my mistake.
The man spoke hesitatingly of his childhood. He had
the Frenchman's conventional and inconsequent respect
for his mother&mdash;inconsequent considering the unceremonious
manner in which she has previously been
treated, as a woman. In this case the conduct of the
mother had been painfully out of order. The Frenchman
reverences his mother surprisingly indeed, but on strict
condition that she carries out her <i>rôle</i> in absolute
conformity with expected sentiments. <i>La mère</i> is <i>la
mère</i>, neither more nor less, an esteemed functionary
rather than a private individual. Is this to be doubted
in the country under whose laws the mother is unhesitatingly
sacrificed in the case of having to choose
between her life and the child's?
</p>

<p>
So poor Tartarin's state of mind must have been most
complex, for his mother had shown a spirit anything but
official. She could not stand uninterrupted family life,
it appears, and used to go off at intervals in a sort of
exasperation, for a week or a month of solitude. Tartarin
spoke of it with bated breath, not severely, but sadly, for
was she not <i>la mère</i>? She appears to have shown
singularly small appreciation of the creditable fact.
What she had, at moments, permitted herself to remark
about <i>les enfants et la famille</i> generally, her good son
refrained from quoting, but I gathered that it was
something truly appalling! Of course this led to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
quarrels; the neighbours were scandalised, and incited
the husband to take strong measures, and that was
the end.
</p>

<p>
"If you had but let me go now and then I would not
have left you," she cried, as she fled from the house never
to return. And thus Tartarin and his sister had been
deprived in their early years of <i>la tendresse d'une mère</i>.
He spoke of it with a sort of self-pity, evidently engendered
by the comments of indignant neighbours and by the
sentiments of a maiden-aunt who joyfully seized the
happy opportunity to fill the place thus left vacant. The
brother and sister had therefore enjoyed all the <i>tendresse</i>
that they could have desired, and evidently it was as like
the ordinary <i>tendresse d'une mere</i> as one egg is like
another. For there was nothing in the way of alternate
embracings and irrelevant punishments that had been
lacking in the system of education of that admirable
aunt. She had worshipped the children; so altogether
it was difficult to see what the pair had missed. They
had certainly gained the prestige of their misfortune, for
all Tarascon had petted and pitied them.
</p>

<p>
"And where do <i>I</i> come in?" the aunt might have
inquired, but she never did. On the contrary, she started
the chorus and shed the signal-tear, so that little Tartarin
and Antoinette evidently had a splendid time of it.
</p>

<p>
And was the truant mother still living? Yes, she had
a little property, a little house at Arles where she passed
her days. And now and then Tartarin and his sister
went to see her. The mother was glad to welcome them,
and, as far as I could gather, she was fond of Tartarin,
not exactly as a son, but as a good fellow whose <i>bonhomie</i>
and urbane philosophy appealed to her. It was a curious
story, and a most unexpected one in this out of the way
city of the south.
</p>

<p>
The drive had taken about a couple of hours, time well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
spent, apart from the charm of the country we had
passed through, for a human life, in its emotions as well
as in its events, had been unrolled before me.
</p>

<p>
And strangely pathetic it was; the life of this good-hearted,
disillusioned, unembittered philosopher, who,
with a sort of sad cheerfulness, waited in fair weather
and foul under the plane-trees in the main street, trying
to tempt the tourist to take the round of the sights&mdash;preferably
the whole round, but if that piece of good-luck
failed him, then "<i>sans Beaucaire</i>."
</p>

<p>
Yes, sometimes his heart was a little heavy; he was
more or less dependent on his employer, he was solitary
though he had many good comrades among the people of
his native town. But he was spared anxiety in that his
risks were his own and his alone; but he had no one to
live for, no one to care for. A wife, as he had before
declared, he would not have; <i>la misère à deux</i> was not
the route to happiness; and in his case <i>la famille</i> had not
proved comforting. Often when he went back to Bottin's
after the day's work, he felt a sinking of the heart, for,
after all, was it a life, this? But "<i>enfin, que voulez-vous?</i>"
He was better off than many a poor devil, and
so he said to himself: "<i>Raphael</i>" (for that was poor
Tartarin's real name), "<i>Raphael, mon vieux, tu es donc un
imbécile</i>."
</p>

<p>
And that usually restored him to a more satisfactory
frame of mind; though there were times when even this
rousing adjuration lost its efficacy. At these moments
the gloom would last the night and pursue him when he
went to his work next morning, and he would feel as if
he could endure the empty monotony no longer.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly&mdash;a ray of sunshine, the flight of a bird,
and all the dark thoughts would melt away!
</p>

<p>
I almost started as Tartarin said these words. As a
philosopher I already knew him, but here was an artist!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We parted with many expressions of good-will, I
promising to send him a copy of Maeterlinck's "La
Sagesse et la Destinée," for I thought he might gain
comfort and enjoyment from a philosophy which had
many points in common with his own. Perhaps the
Belgian poet would help him a step or two further on his
road, and teach him to know the value of the wisdom he
had already won.
</p>

<p>
In acknowledgment, he sent me an illustrated post-card
of the Pont du Gard, with a charming little inscription
expressing his gratitude for my having thus remembered
"<i>le pauvre cocher</i>."
</p>

<p>
And this good-hearted philosopher will hereafter always
be to me the real Tartarin de Tarascon.

CHAPTER XV
</p>

<p class="center">BEAUCAIRE AND ITS LOVE-STORY
</p>

<p>
Beaucaire, it may be remembered, has a hill-set castle
opposite King René's at Tarascon. The two stand
frowning at one another across the river, unforgetful of
their old feuds.
</p>

<p>
The town was the property of the Counts of Toulouse,
before the Albigensian wars snuffed out that great family,
and it had its share of suffering in those desperate persecutions.
The Pope gave all their domains to his
accomplice, Simon de Montfort, because Raimon VI. of
Toulouse&mdash;one of the noblest figures of the Middle Ages&mdash;had
dared to oppose the massacre of the helpless
Albigenses.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
At last the young Count raises a revolt against de
Montfort while the latter is at Beaucaire. It is a relief
to hear of his being seriously opposed after all the
atrocities that he has committed in this exquisite land,
all the savage destruction of beautiful things and thoughts
of which he is guilty. He is, indeed, almost as terrible a
scourge as his coadjutor, the Puritan of the north; they
are spiritual twins: the soldier who persecutes with
fire and sword, and the equally pitiless and bigoted saint
who persecutes with the fire and sword of the spirit,
rejoicing, he too, when the gladness and the passion of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
life lie bleeding beneath his feet. Between them, in their
different spheres, they have lain low how much of beauty
and of happiness!
</p>

<p class="p2">
The persecution of the Albigenses broke up the whole
delicate edifice of what one may call the troubadour
civilisation and plunged the country once more into chaos.
</p>

<p>
The luckless Count of Toulouse found himself obliged
to lay siege to his own castle of Beaucaire, where de
Montfort was installed with a powerful garrison.
</p>

<p>
It is a dream of peace and beauty now, as we approach
it up a hill-side through pine-trees and irises, a wonderful
sight surely in the season of blossoming.
</p>

<p>
An old Provençal poem gives an account of the siege:
a sharp battering-ram injured the wall, but the
besieged ingeniously made loops of cord attached to a
beam, and noosed the head of the too-lively ram and held
it imprisoned and harmless. Then, after the fashion of
the day, they let down sulphur and boiling pitch upon
the enemy by means of a chain, the materials being
wrapped in sackcloth. Finally de Montfort&mdash;perhaps
for the first time in his life&mdash;is defeated, after a fierce
struggle, for the Powers of Darkness had deserted their
faithful servant, who shortly afterwards ended his
atrocious career at the siege of Toulouse, which had
revolted against him.
</p>

<p>
After passing through the grove of pines and irises, we
emerge upon a sunlit plateau high above the town, and
the ruins of the castle are before us.
</p>

<p>
These and a fine little Romanesque chapel in which
St. Louis said Mass before starting for the Crusades, give
character to the scene&mdash;a beautiful background to the
famous old story of Aucassin and Nicolette.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"The adventures of the lovers," says Pater, "seem to
be chosen for the happy occasion they afford of keeping
the eye of the fancy, perhaps the outward eye, fixed on
pleasant objects, a garden, a ruined tower, the little hut
of flowers which Nicolette constructs in the forest....
All through it one feels the influence of that faint air of
overwrought delicacy, almost of wantonness, which was
so strong a characteristic of the poetry of the Troubadours.
The Troubadours themselves were often men of
great rank; they wrote for an exclusive audience, people
of much leisure and great refinement.... There is a
languid Eastern deliciousness in the very scenery of the
story, the full-blown roses, the chamber painted in some
mysterious manner where Nicolette is imprisoned, the
cool brown marble, the almost nameless colours, the
odour of plucked grass and flowers. Nicolette herself
well becomes this scenery, and is the best illustration of
the quality I mean&mdash;the beautiful, weird, foreign girl,
whom the shepherds take for a fay...."
</p>

<p>
We sit down at the foot of the walls to rest. Above
us stands the curious three-cornered tower built by the
Visigoths during their rule in the South of France in
late days of the Empire. The object was to oppose only
the angle of the building to the enemy's assault, while
the garrison could attack from the sides as usual.
</p>

<p>
Was this the tower in which Aucassin was imprisoned
by his father, the Count of Beaucaire, to prevent his
marrying the little Saracen maid Nicolette? Was it
here that she watched and waited on one moonlit night,
long ago, hearing Aucassin lamenting in his captivity?
One likes to think of the good sentinel ostentatiously
humming a warning song, when he heard the town-guards
advancing to kill the devoted Nicolette, by order
of the Count.
</p>

<p>
I had copied out some of the songs and fragments of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
the story from Andrew Lang's translation, in order to
have the pleasure of reading them on the spot.
</p>

<p>
Barbara was much amused at Aucassin's interview
with the Captain of the City of Beaucaire who had
imprisoned Nicolette in his house, by the Count's command.
</p>

<p>
Poor Aucassin is very disconsolate, and in his distress
he makes some very free remarks about Heaven and hell,
pointing out that in Heaven the company is intolerably
dull, whereas all the jolly good fellows and pleasant ladies
are to be found&mdash;elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
"With these I would gladly go," he says, "let me but
have with me my sweetest lady."
</p>

<p>
But nobody will allow that; for the way of the world
is to be immensely active about other people's business.
So the Count and all the rest of Aucassin's nearest
and dearest bestir themselves to separate him and
Nicolette.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Aucassin did so depart</p>
<p>Much in dole and heavy of heart</p>
<p>For his love so bright and dear,</p>
<p>None might bring him any cheer....</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Nicolette, how fair art thou,</p>
<p>Sweet thy foot-fall, sweet thine eyes,</p>
<p>Sweet the mirth of thy replies,</p>
<p>Sweet thy laughter, sweet thy face,</p>
<p>Sweet thy lips and sweet thy brow,</p>
<p>And the touch of thine embrace...."</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
Nicolette's escape from prison was much appreciated
by Barbara.
</p>

<p>
"Nicolette lay one night on her bed, and saw the
moon shine clear through a window, yea, and heard the
nightingale sing in the garden, so she minded her of
Aucassin her lover, whom she loved so well."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then it goes on to tell how she knotted linen and
sheets together and let herself down from her window.
</p>

<p>
"Her locks were yellow and curled, her eyes blue and
smiling, her face neatly fashioned.... She came to the
postern gate, and unbarred it, and went out through the
streets of Beaucaire, keeping always on the shadowy
side, for the moon was shining right clear, and so
wandered she till she came to the tower where her lover
lay."
</p>

<p>
"Just here," said Barbara, looking up.
</p>

<p>
"The tower was flanked with buttresses&mdash;" the
account continues.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't!" cried Barbara in disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"Architecture is so often inaccurate," I suggest, soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"And she cowered under one of them, wrapped in her
mantle. Then thrust she her head through a crevice of
the tower that was old and worn, and so heard she
Aucassin wailing within...."
</p>

<p>
And then she tells him all that has happened, and not
being able to reach her hand to him, she casts her curls
into the dungeon, and&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Aucassin doth clasp them there,</p>
<p>Kissed the curls that were so fair...."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
It is a love scene almost more charming than that of
Romeo and Juliet, for it seems more genuine. Aucassin
does not say such elaborate things, but there is a glow
and fervour about his utterances that commends itself
to us as ringing beautifully true.
</p>

<p>
They argue about which of them loves the most, until
at last the town-guard comes along, "with swords drawn
beneath their cloaks, for the Count Garin had charged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
them that if they could take Nicolette they should slay
her."
</p>

<p>
But luckily the sentinel on the towers sees them
coming, and decides, as we have seen, to befriend
Nicolette, "for if they slay her, then were Aucassin,
my damoiseau, dead, and that were great pity."
</p>

<p>
So the sentinel considerately sings a song in which he
gives a broad hint of what is menacing, and Nicolette
shrinks under the shadow of a pillar till the men have
passed. Finally she jumps down into the fosse and,
hurt and bruised as she is, climbs the castle wall and
goes out into the forest, where she builds "a little hut of
flowers as a token to Aucassin that she had passed that
way." Later, Aucassin finds her there after many
wanderings, and they are happy for a little while.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
And so, through adventures and sorrows, the story
goes till the lovers are hopelessly parted&mdash;pirates,
tempests, Saracens are banded against them, and
Nicolette seems lost for ever.
</p>

<p>
The final scene is once more in this old castle, after
many years, when Count Garin is dead and Aucassin
rules in his stead. Then comes a minstrel&mdash;a woman&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
the castle, with a "vielle." Aucassin, we may suppose,
was taking a walk along the ramparts. And suddenly
he hears a voice singing to the vielle in the castle
court below. He listens and the song makes him weep;
and he asks for more songs. And the singer sings again,
about strange adventures; and the story is that of Nicolette!
And finally, the minstrel runs away to Aucassin's
mother in the castle and throws off her disguise. The
Countess is overjoyed, for she has been in despair at her
son's incurable grief; and she dresses Nicolette in splendid
raiment and leads her back to the bewildered
Aucassin. And then there is a meeting such as happens
rarely in human story. Deep sorrow has been gnawing
in Aucassin's heart, and he had never married, in spite of
much urging by his friends. And suddenly he knows
that the day of his tribulation is over, and the deepest
joy he can ever feel has come to him after weary waiting.
And once more, with a rapture learnt of long sorrow and
heartache, he folds Nicolette in his arms.
</p>

<p>
And soon afterwards their marriage feast is prepared
with great pomp and ceremony, and Beaucaire has a
splendid time of it with tournaments and jousts and
dancing. And in the good old fashion, Aucassin and
Nicolette are not only married&mdash;which any fools can be&mdash;but
they are happy ever after!

CHAPTER XVI

<p class="center">CARCASSONNE, THE ALBIGENSES AND PIERRE VIDAL
</p>

<p>
With the siege of Beaucaire fresh in our minds, Simon
de Montfort and Count Raimon VI. of Toulouse became
enrolled among the names that jumped to the eyes
wherever they occurred. We pursued any trail that led
to further particulars of these two men who satisfied the
human instinct to worship, on the one hand, and to
whole-heartedly abominate on the other.
</p>

<p>
There was no call at any time to moderate one's
detestation of de Montfort on account of some untimely
incident betraying him in amiable sidelights. He was
never discovered playing at ninepins with the children
of his captive foe, or chivalrously endowing with a competence
for life the widow of the wretch whom he had
sent to die in his deepest dungeons. Never was he
caught in unguarded moments of virtue; never did he
tarnish the full gloss of his villainy by any little inconsistency
of honour or compunction. He went on adding
contempt to our hatred by a splendid and unremitting
variety of treachery and baseness. At his worst, he
was a fiend incarnate; and a better moment he never
had.

<p>
Thus for the purposes of melodrama he was invaluable.
He gave one's emotions no trouble. He was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
beautifully consistent, unmitigated ruffian, and it was a
pleasure to undisturbedly loathe him.
</p>

<p>
Count Raimon of Toulouse and Viscount of Béziers
made a very good companion-opposite to this satisfactory
scoundrel.
</p>

<p>
The two seemed to fill the position in our affections
of a handsome pair of ornaments on a well-regulated
mantelpiece&mdash;related by the sharpness of their contrast:
Summer and Winter, Vice and Virtue, or the little
meteorological man and woman who appear at the house-door,
one in and one out (never both at the same time),
to indicate fair or foul weather&mdash;perhaps also as a sly
comment on domestic felicity!
</p>

<p>
Count Raimon and his companion interested us more
especially when we entered Languedoc, the Count's own
territory and the principal scene of the Albigensian wars.
Beaucaire, as we had seen, which also belonged to
Count Raimon, had fallen into the hands of the arch-villain,
but there his wonderful luck at last deserted
him.
</p>

<p>
The Pope had set his mind on consolidating the power
of the Church and on annexing the lands of the few
reigning nobles who protected the Albigenses. Of these
Count Raimon of Toulouse was the most determined. He
is one of the most striking examples of religious toleration,
almost the only one, at the beginning of the thirteenth
century. Without any leanings towards the doctrines of
the heretics, he yet stood by them from first to last,
trying by every means in his power to avert the fury of
the Pope and the Crusaders. He tried diplomacy, he
tried conciliation, but without avail. He held firm in his
refusal to hand over any subjects in his dominions, whatsoever
their faith, to the fury of the Inquisition. Fortune
was against him, with Innocent the Third on the throne,
St. Dominic, the powerful originator of the terrible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
tribunal on the persecuting side, and Simon de Montfort
as its military leader.
</p>

<p>
The Pope had actually recalled the Crusaders from the
Holy Land to turn their arms against their own kindred.
Heretics at home, he held, were more dangerous than
infidels abroad. The war-intoxicated Defenders of the
Faith needed no incitement. Their ruthless savagery
has cast a shadow over the land to this day. This
shadow hangs heavily over the scene of the worst
atrocities of the war, and it was remarkable how the
radiance so thrillingly pervasive in Provence failed to
follow us into the richer country of Languedoc.
</p>

<p>
Count Raimon's persistent defence of his Albigensian
subjects kept the war centred more or less within his
dominions, of which Toulouse was the capital.
</p>

<p>
Here, in Languedoc, it was, above all, that the gracious
life which we had learnt to associate with the troubadours
was blotted out and quenched in a very sea of
blood and suffering.
</p>

<p>
It is saddening, too, to think that one of those very
singers in his later days became infected with the spirit
of the Church, and ended as one of the most ferocious of
the persecutors.
</p>

<p>
This renegade was Folquet of Marseilles, who loved
Azalais, the wife of Count Barral of Marseilles. He
was of a tenacious, zealous, gloomy temperament&mdash;not
at all of the true troubadour spirit&mdash;and this characteristic
afterwards shows itself in his ardour against the heretics.
</p>

<p>
"Too late," he laments, "I have discovered love's
falsehood: I am like one who swears never to gamble
again after he has lost his whole fortune." Azalais dies,
and Folquet enters the monastery of Citeaux. And then
he becomes Abbot of Toulouse in the heart of the Albigensian
troubles. From that time forth he devotes
himself to persecution.

<p>
The taking of the hill-set city of Béziers, where a
brilliant Court used to be held, is one of the most
terrible incidents in this twenty years' war.
</p>

<p>
"Kill! kill!" shouted the leaders; "Kill! kill!" the
cry was echoed through the blazing city, and sixty
thousand souls are said to have perished on that awful day.
</p>

<p>
Folquet, the ex-troubadour, had been told that heretics
and faithful were being indiscriminately massacred.
</p>

<p>
"Slay them," he cried; "God will know his own."
</p>

<p>
There is also a similar story about de Montfort, to
whom two heretics were brought: one firm in the faith,
the other open to conviction.
</p>

<p>
"Burn them both," shouted de Montfort. "If this
fellow means what he says the fire will expiate his sins;
and if he lies he will suffer for his imposture."
</p>

<p>
We saw the city of Béziers from the windows of the
train: a picturesque mass of houses climbing up a steep
hill to cluster round the fine fortress-cathedral&mdash;another
characteristic example of the architecture of Southern
France.
</p>

<p>
Our train puffed along the valley of the Aude to the
famous walled city of Carcassonne, the next scene of
this savage drama.
</p>

<p>
It was here that Count Raimon&mdash;or the Viscount of
Béziers, as he was also called&mdash;had established himself
when the news came of the fall of Béziers. A bad day
that must have been for the Count and his garrison!
His brother-in-law, King Pedro of Arragon, had come to
help him in this almost hopeless cause, and he went at
once to mediate with the Crusaders, pleading Raimon's
own unimpeachable orthodoxy.
</p>

<p>
But it was of no use. The Defenders of the Faith
were panting for plunder and massacre. They said the
Count and twelve knights might depart in peace, but the
town must be given up and every other soul in it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"That shall be when an ass flies to heaven," replied
the Count, and prepared for defence.
</p>

<p>
It was almost with a sense that we were to be present
at one of the most terrible moments in mediæval history
that we watched the flying landscape for a first sight of
Carcassonne on its height.
</p>

<p>
Who could ever forget that first impression of it, as
the train slowed up to the station of the lower town in
the valley and a strange vision came into the sky of a
double-walled mediæval city with a forest of towers
rising tall and pointed through the mists and mystery
of a far-away romance?
</p>

<p>
This was a return to the Middle Ages indeed!
</p>

<p>
The hotel omnibus trundled us&mdash;amid a vibrating
heap of rugs, handbags, umbrellas&mdash;through the ancient
streets of the lower town, which the natives spoke of as
"modern" to distinguish it from "la Cité," which was
far more ancient, seeing that it possessed more than one
tower belonging to the misty times of the Visigothic
kingdom, whose capital was at Toulouse.
</p>

<p>
As we drove, the turn of the road placed us at different
angles with the City of Dreams; and it stood the test.
</p>

<p>
No sign of fading away, or of dwindling into anything
less than its astonishing self.
</p>

<p>
At the hotel we were received by a most elegant landlady
in widow's garb. If it had not been for her pressing
us to have our lunch before we started, I feel sure that
we should have been off and up to the <i>cité</i> without a
moment's delay. However, we first made acquaintance
with this lady's wonderful <i>cuisine</i> in the old, low-pitched
<i>salle-à-manger</i>, where only a few Frenchmen of the commercial
type were taking their luncheon. We were
neither of us much given to what we called "fussing
over our food," but it was impossible for the most
benighted of women to fail to notice the delicate art
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
which distinguished every detail of the repast. What
we had I cannot remember, but it was a succession
of masterpieces. Such modulation of flavours, such
opposing of salt and sweet, acid and flat, creamy and
piquant; such coquetry in the salad dressing, such
sentiment in the sauces! It was wonderful, as all true
art is.
</p>

<p>
Altogether Carcassonne was a place of artistic
achievement.
</p>

<p>
The city, as we wended our way towards it, grew more
and more dazzling to the sense of reality. That progress
through the lower town, across the Aude, was like walking
straight into the background of a mediæval painting&mdash;and
who has not longed for that excursion? There
was not a sight or a sound to mar the perfection of the
place. Doubtless in the old days there would have been
more stir as one approached the great double-towered
gateway and crossed the bridge over what was once a
moat. And there would have been sentries, and perhaps
the flash of armour caught between the crenellations of
the lower outer walls. Otherwise precisely the same
sights and sounds met our senses as met those of the
wayfarers of the thirteenth century.
</p>

<p>
Immediately within the inner walls there is a street of
smallish houses. But soon we diverge from this and are
admitted by the custodian&mdash;a most singular person, by
the way&mdash;through a side door and up a steep staircase to
the ramparts.
</p>

<p>
And here on emerging, one holds one's breath. Towers,
towers, and more towers; towers with high conical roofs
in fantastic medley; round towers, square towers, tall,
emaciated towers springing above the mass of building;
towers with crenellated parapets showing rounded contours
to the enemy and flat sides to the town; Visigoth
towers recalling the momentous days when barbarian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
races began to swarm and settle in the fertile provinces
of Roman Gaul.
</p>

<p>
Wonderful was that walk round the walls passing
through the long procession of the towers. It was a
veritable city of towers, moving like living figures as we
moved, appearing in new groups between the houses,
opening into vistas, falling back and reappearing.
</p>

<p>
It seemed as if those silent sentinels were trying to
keep us always in view, stealing out cautiously from
behind the buildings, crossing, falling back, making
way for one another, with a sort of secret movement
round the whole circle of their orbit.
</p>

<p>
There were great flights of steps corbelled out on the
inner side of the ramparts, apparently to provide a means
of descending to the city, and also of reaching certain
points of the fortifications. There were gateways,
barbicans, turrets, and a marvellous everchanging series
of architectural groupings; walls, bulwarks, battlements.
</p>

<p>
Below were the outer walls, within which was a
spacious grassy enclosure where the men-at-arms used
to keep guard.
</p>

<p>
Citywards, there was the castle, and the cathedral.
And at the foot of the ramparts, backing into them,
were the little gardens of the citizens of Carcassonne.
Boughs would sway against the masonry&mdash;Merovingian
some of these splendid blocks of stone!&mdash;while the bright,
quiet sun of a November afternoon poured with broad,
equal glow into the silent city.
</p>

<p>
And far away on the horizon, miles and miles beyond
the sweeping plains of Languedoc, the faint white peaks
of the Pyrenees!
</p>

<p class="p2">
Our guide was the most singular of men. Whether he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
had a patriotic hatred of the English I cannot tell, but he
did his best to ignore our presence altogether.
</p>

<p>
Having reeled off his stock information&mdash;(not to us,
but to the universe generally)&mdash;he would retire and lean
gloomily over the battlements as if he were taking a stroll
on his own account and were contemplating life from the
pessimist standpoint. Perhaps he was resisting an inclination
to dispose of us mediævally in one of the
oubliettes.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he would gaze down into the gardens below
as if he were watching some one at whose folly he was
thoroughly disgusted. Yet not a soul was to be seen.
An attempt at geniality on our part was met in the most
freezing manner. There was something really extraordinary
about the man, and I incline to think he was
either a patriot sustaining his country's honour by this
simple means, or a person suffering from melancholy
madness of a very aggravated type.
</p>

<p>
Even if he unlocked a door for us he studied the far
distance till we had passed through. Then he re-locked
the door and hurried on in front as if dreading we should
ask him stupid questions. It may be he was horribly
bored by this eternal round of the bulwarks with foolish
tourists.
</p>

<p>
The longer we lingered on the ramparts of Carcassonne
the more incredible it appeared that the town
could ever be taken by the means of assault available in
the thirteenth century. Yet taken we sadly knew that
it was, and by Simon de Montfort!
</p>

<p>
That was virtually the end of the house of Toulouse
and of the cause of the Albigenses.
</p>

<p>
The lower outer walls were as solid as they could be.
Then between the outer and inner walls were stationed
sentries and men-at-arms. But supposing these dangers
to be overcome, and the foe to aspire to pass through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
high inner walls, from whose battlements hundreds of
arrows might be flying and boiling pitch be pouring,
perhaps the assailant would rush up some cunning,
wall-embedded staircase which seemed to promise access
to the city or the ramparts. But instead of that it would
turn out, after many windings and confused branchings,
to be merely a blind passage fashioned thus on purpose
to mislead an enemy and prevent his surprising the town.
Moreover, even if the impossible were achieved and those
vast walls scaled, there was still the castle or inner
fortress, where the inhabitants could all collect in time
of emergency and bid defiance to every foe except hunger
and thirst.
</p>

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Probably Count Raimon and his garrison expected to
be able to hold out against de Montfort in spite of the
invariable success of the latter. One can imagine with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
what ardour the preparations were made for the defence:
every watch-tower and turret, every outlook and barbican
haunted by anxious faces scanning the country.
</p>

<p>
And then the attack! The first assault was led by
the prelates solemnly chanting the "Veni Creator," and
the God of the Christians was called upon to fight on
the side of slayers and torturers, of murderers of unarmed
citizens and women and children. It was de Montfort
who boasted: "Neither age nor sex have we spared; we
have slain all!"
</p>

<p>
This first onslaught was repulsed, and perhaps if it
had not been for a failure in the water supply, the
beautiful city and its noble cause might have prevailed.
</p>

<p>
How they must have prayed for rain in that wondrous
colour-flooded cathedral, when day after day the cruel,
cloudless heavens smiled down ironically upon the dusty
streets and glaring walls!
</p>

<p>
At last a parley was arranged between the Count and
the besiegers. They gave him a pledge of safe conduct,
and he went out to the camp. In the service of Heaven
and the Church, the Crusaders considered ordinary
honour and good faith superfluous&mdash;the usual plea of a
good motive for villainous deeds&mdash;and they traitorously
seized him, and when the city fell they threw him into
a dungeon in his own citadel at Carcassonne&mdash;with all
the beautiful precepts of chivalry ringing in their ears&mdash;a
piece of work after de Montfort's own heart.
</p>

<p>
It is better not to dwell on the sack of the city: a sack
of the thirteenth century conducted by de Montfort.
</p>

<p>
"For thou hast delivered them to the vilest of mortal
men," the Comte de Foix had exclaimed to the Pope,
speaking of the Albigenses at the Council of the Lateran,
"to Simon de Montfort."
</p>

<p>
Count Raimon died in prison, nobody knows by what
means. We were shown the noisome little hole in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
which the noble and tolerant spirit saw the last of
this sad and cruel and beautiful world.
</p>

<p>
In virtue of the poet's faculty of imaginative sympathy
Pierre Cardinal, the famous troubadour, had the insight
to understand the nobility of this man born centuries too
soon.
</p>

<p>
"As water in the fountain, so chivalry has its source
in him. Against the basest of men, nay, against the
whole world he stands." So writes the poet of the hero.
It was a sorry age in which to be born before one's
time!
</p>

<p>
Happily there are other and brighter memories to
associate with Carcassonne. The troubadour of far
renown, Pierre Vidal, must have often passed in and
out at the great gateway: that delightful, foolish,
brilliant personage; courtly, naif, and infinitely charming,
yet pathetically unsuccessful, for all his genius&mdash;perhaps
partly because of it. He was born at
Toulouse, and so belonged to this country, then ruled
by Raimon V., but his fate was chiefly active at the
court of Marseilles where he fell in love with Azalais
de Rocca Martina, wife of Count Barral, a lady who is
described as possessing "charms of the sort that intoxicate;
an emotional power, a magnetism, a luxurious
will that swept all resistance away." He called her
"Vierna," and wrote his canzos to her under that
name.
</p>

<p>
One of his biographers says of him: "He was one of
the most foolish men who ever lived, for he believed
everything to be just as it pleased him, and as he would
have it." It is a moot point whether this may not be
rather wisdom than folly, for believing things to be as
one desires them often goes a long way towards fulfilling
that tacit prophecy.
</p>

<p>
Alas, things were not exactly as Vidal wished, in spite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
of his pleasant believings, but he had rosy hours and
sang enchanting songs and gave much joy with his
gifts and his charm. "Vierna," however, did not at
all appreciate him. She gave him a ring and a little
perfunctory graciousness, as she was bound to do to
sustain her character as a courteous lady; but she
appears to have wearied of his songs and his devotion.
At last her husband tried to reconcile her to the troubadour,
and to induce her to treat him more kindly. Vidal
lost heart after a time, and concluded he was a fool.
</p>

<p>
"But beauty makes the sanest man go mad," he sang
or said, and though he had many love-affairs and fancies,
they seem to have been of slight seriousness compared
with his passion for Azalais. In his erratic life, he
haunted the neighbourhood of Carcassonne and Toulouse;
visited Albi&mdash;whence the luckless Albigenses took their
name&mdash;and Saissac and Cabaret near Carcassonne. In
Provence he had an unpleasant adventure at St. Gilles,
where the husband of a lady to whom he addressed love-songs
and of whose love he had boasted, became enraged
and bored the poet's too eloquent tongue.
</p>

<p>
In these strange times, the exquisite chivalric civilisation
being but newly formed&mdash;like a sheet of ice on a
dark pool&mdash;had very thin places. Vidal's friend Ugo
del Baux bore him off&mdash;perhaps to his wonderful eyrie
in the Alpilles&mdash;and nursed him till he was well again.
</p>

<p>
Vidal's wanderings were far and wide in Languedoc
and Provence. We even hear of him singing in the
little grey hill-top village of Beuil in the mountains to
the north of Nice.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Near Carcassonne lived a famous beauty, Loba de
Pegnautier. She inhabited the fortified town of Cabaret,
and there knights and troubadours flocked to visit her,
among them Pierre Vidal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The story goes that in order to please her he adopted
the crest or emblem of a Wolf in compliment to her
name, Loba; and, dressed in a wolf-skin, ran out into
the field and had himself hunted by the shepherds with
their dogs. But Loba only made fun of him, and it
appears that the shepherds hunted him rather too
seriously, and altogether the foolish poet came off unhappily
in this fantastic scheme of love-making.
</p>

<p>
He is said to have joined Richard Cœur de Lion in
his Crusade, to have visited Spain and Italy, notably the
Court of Montferrat, and everywhere to have pursued
his troubadour's calling and the will-of-the-wisp of a
satisfying love.
</p>

<p>
He once tried boldness with Azalais and ventured
on stealing a kiss one morning while she was sleeping.
But he lived to rue the day. She fell into a passion of
anger and refused to accept any apology. However, he
murmured ancient saws about women and hoped on.
Count Barral laughed at his wife for taking the wild
poet's doings so seriously. She was not to be appeased,
and finally Vidal went off to Cyprus and characteristically
married a Princess who claimed the title of Empress
of the Eastern Empire. And the two set up an Imperial
Court and ordered an expensive throne, and thoroughly
enjoyed themselves until Vidal had spent all his money.
Presumably the Princess died, or they parted, and then
Barral insisted on Vidal's returning to Provence; and he
met him joyously at Les Baux, and brought him home
to Marseilles where Azalais welcomed him with a freely
given kiss as a token of forgiveness. And poor Vidal
breaks out into a veritable spring-song of joy and thankfulness.
But the Countess tired of him very soon, and
never had the least idea of returning his passion.
</p>

<p>
So he starts again on his wanderings, and goes all
over the world with one patron and friend after another,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
and so ends his strange, brilliant, joyous, troubled, unsatisfied
life.
</p>

<p>
With all his natural susceptibility and need of affection
he seems never to have overcome his love for the beautiful
Azalais, nor, with all his charm, does he appear to
have been able to inspire a serious attachment in any of
the innumerable ladies to whom he warbled his graceful
canzos. He never seems to have thoroughly grown up,
and probably no woman capable of passionate attachment
could have bestowed the full flood of it on a nature so
immature.
</p>

<p>
What exactly the quality or qualities may be that
bestow the power of inspiring a <i>grande passion</i> is one
of the unfathomed mysteries of the heart. Vidal possessed
every attribute that could charm&mdash;or so one
would suppose&mdash;yet ladies only laughed at him affectionately,
petted him, and gave their hearts elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
He is one of the most attractive and pathetic of the
troubadours, and gives the impression of a sort of erratic
genius. His naïveté is astonishing and charming, in
spite of his outrageous habit of boasting of his successes
in love and war.
</p>

<p>
One can easily picture the richly-dressed figure issuing
from the great gates of Carcassonne on his beautiful
horse&mdash;his horse was surely a noble one&mdash;followed by
his accompanist and his servant, who carried his vielle;
and we saw him in our mind's eye riding through the
country on his way to Cabaret to pay homage to Loba
de Pegnautier&mdash;and so he fades into the far away.
</p>

<p>
Alas, those beautiful towers and walls were destined
to be battered and broken by de Montfort and his
Crusaders, as we have seen. And it was not long after
the taking of the city that the cause of the Albigenses
was finally lost on the field of Muret, in this district.
De Montfort was killed a little later by a stone at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
siege of Toulouse, and a yell of joy and execration went
up from the whole Midi which he had tortured so
hideously.
</p>

<p>
We saw his tomb in the cathedral at Carcassonne&mdash;and
wondered! Our feelings of hatred died away in the
glory of that cathedral.
</p>

<p>
When we entered, we found ourselves suddenly bathed
in waves of colour.
</p>

<p>
The entire east end of the building was a splendid
expanse of stained glass stretching from floor to roof, and
from wall to wall: the whole breadth of the cathedral,
divided only by a few slender mullions. The transmuted
glow of the afternoon sun was flooding the church,
kindling the tints of the glass to the liquid glory of gems;
and it was perfectly, radiantly still.
</p>

<p>
After all, it is unspeakable pity rather than hatred
that madmen like de Montfort ought to inspire; for
frenzied cruelty such as his implied a misery and darkness
of spirit beyond the power of human speech to
express, and surely, sooner or later, an awful expiation.
</p>

<p>
"But what opinion was it that the Albigenses held
which made the Pope and the Crusaders treat them so
ferociously?" cried Barbara, bewildered at the accounts
of their cruelty and of de Montfort's specially hateful
savageries. Well might she ask!
</p>

<p>
For one thing, the Albigenses <i>would</i> have it that three
nails were used at the Crucifixion; whereas all true
believers know that there were four&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Barbara stared.
</p>

<p>
I had chapter and verse for it. A learned controversialist
had denounced the Three Nail view as unworthy
of Catholics and Christians.
</p>

<p>
"And for that they killed and racked and tortured&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
In truth it was for that among other errors of doctrine.
It is difficult to find out what the Albigenses really
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
believed, for they were so calumniated. Baring-Gould
contends that they had revived the ancient paganism of
the country.
</p>

<p>
They believed in two forces, a good and an evil: the
nine-lived Manichæan heresy.
</p>

<p>
But that belief is represented in our good old friend the
Devil, who, indeed, is probably a remnant of Pagan ideas.
They rejected the Trinity, refused to worship saints, and
discouraged marriage. They seemed very much like any
other enthusiastic sect that breaks off from the main
body of believers, and is ready to die for Three Nails
instead of the orthodox Four. Will the history of
religious persecution never cure people of their Three-Nail
controversies?

The name has an aroma of romance, and a sort of

<p>
Once it was a splendid city spreading along the shores
of the lagoon; now there remains but a solitary church,
one of the characteristic fortress-churches of the Midi, a
bare, primitive-looking building, closely protected on three
sides by a grove of dark trees, in the centre of a little
island formed by the sea and the lagoons which run, like
an enamelled chain, all along these mournful coasts.
</p>

<p>
One can reach the island by boat across the lagoons
from the little cardboard town of Palavas where the
people of Montpellier go in summer for sea-bathing. In
very calm weather it is possible to approach the isle by
sea. The church is a most singular piece of early
Christian architecture, without a window in the white,
thick walls; and above, one sees the curved machicolations,
as in a fortress, whence boiling lead and oil could
be poured down on the heads of Saracen assailants, those
terrible enemies of whom the ancient church builders
stood in such dread.
</p>

<p>
Of the original Mother Church of St. Peter there has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
survived only the principal nave, "flanked before the
destruction of the city with several towers."
</p>

<p>
It has "curved machicolations going from one buttress
to the next," and is considered one of the most complete
types of the fortified churches of the Middle Ages, "which
are ranged in a line along the coast."
</p>

<p>
The church of Maguelonne has fine Romanesque
windows, and arches of full half-circle, and resembles a
fortress almost more than a church.
</p>

<p>
The inside is very dark and solemn, stirring in the
grave simplicity of its style. True Provençal Romanesque
in its structure of vast arches and apses; the Roman idea
but little modified except in the capitals of the columns
where the classic flow and grace yields to the naïveté of
early Christian sentiment. Indeed, that sentiment very
seriously pervades the whole building. There is none
of the sumptuous triumphant spirit of a grand classic
edifice, although the general lines are the same in both
cases. A careful draughtsman, conscientiously rendering
the church of Maguelonne, might produce a portrait
correct and unrecognisable, as many portraits are; the
bare lines without the meaning behind them, the matter
without the spirit; and a portrait of that sort might be
indistinguishable from that of some great Roman interior&mdash;palace,
bath, hall of justice. The painted hall of the
Villa Madama on the hillside above the Milvian bridge
near Rome is constructed on the same broad scheme of
arch and apse, and above, on vault and spandril, garlanded,
arabesqued, a riot of rosy gods and goddesses&mdash;the
exquisite work of Giulio Romano&mdash;voluptuous, expansive,
rich in beauty and power. Maguelonne with
its classic structure&mdash;a style which had been developed
during centuries for stronger and stronger expression
of Pagan magnificence&mdash;nevertheless breathes forth the
sentiment of poverty and asceticism, the spirit that drove
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
men and women into the wilderness, that set them
writhing under the consciousness of sin, or exalted them
to the state of emotion wherein the pains of martyrdom
were transfigured into ecstasy. Truly a thing of potency
the human spirit! How, by the same general means,
it can express emotions at once so strong and so completely
opposed is one of the great mysteries of art.

<p>
Maguelonne is the last relic of the splendid city of that
name which stood on the opposite shores of the lagoon,
its towers mirrored in the blue water. The island was
first the site of a Greek settlement, then of a Roman
town&mdash;once attacked by Womba, King of the Visigoths;
finally the Saracens built a city there which Charles
Martel destroyed when he changed for good and all the
fortunes of Europe by the great victories which turned
back those marauding people just at the critical moment
when they were on the point of becoming masters of
Christendom. For many years it was the site of a famous
monastic establishment which has earned a reputation
for a mild and beneficent and altogether admirable
administration of great wealth and greater power.
</p>

<p>
Maguelonne is famous for its charming old story of
"Pierre de Provence et la belle Maguelonne," known in
most European countries among the people, and sold at
fairs and markets for a few pence. It was written by a
deacon of Maguelonne, Bernard of the Three Ways, about
whom one desires in vain to know more. The story
is of lovers parted, wandering; exchanging rings which
are carried off by ravens and finally turn up miraculously
inside a tunny fish caught on the coast, and so lead to
the meeting and reunion of the despairing Pierre and
Maguelonne.

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
There are a few small buildings near the church, in one
of which live the woman and her family who look after
it. They do not trouble the visitor with gratuitous information,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
but hand him the key and leave him severely
alone, unless, indeed, he is adventurous and elects to go
on the roof. Then a boy unlocks the staircase door that
gives access to that windy spot, and amuses himself by
sliding down the stone slabs of the roof while the visitor
turns to admire the view of sea, mountains and lagoons
spread forth in a brilliant circle round him. The remarkable
and characteristic roof, however, is what he comes
officially to see. It is formed of thick, overlapping slabs
of stone laid at a gentle slope, and is considered a marvel
of architectural skill.
</p>

<p>
How the problem of weight distribution is solved is,
indeed, difficult to understand. The builders of these
early churches perhaps knew some of the secrets of the
Roman architects who at Nimes, in the Temple of the
Nymphs, have erected a seemingly miraculous ceiling
composed of heavy square stones which are guilty of the
misdemeanour of existing in their places "without visible
means of support." The feat is accounted for, though
it is scarcely made clear, by the fact that on their upper
surfaces the stones are cut so that they are thicker and
heavier on one side than on the other, and thus the
weight is thrown obliquely from stone to stone across the
roof, instead of downwards, a method involving elaborate
mathematical calculations and perfection of workmanship.
</p>

<p>
The twentieth century has no monopoly of ingenuity
after all!
</p>

<p>
Maguelonne makes a beautiful, sad picture as one leaves
it to pass down to the sea. The blank walls with their
arched machicolated abutments&mdash;recalling the fortifications
of the Papal Palace&mdash;look bare and acquainted with
adversity in the blinding sunshine. On the side of the
lagoons the protecting pines crowd round the building
like a sacred grove; and through their branches the sea-wind
makes a low, ominous music.

<p>
Fanfarigoule in the Crau<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a> is the haunt of the ghouls.
</p>

<p>
Let any one wander alone in that extraordinary desert,
and if he have not nerves of steel or a cast-iron imagination
he will understand how it earns that reputation.
As for disputing the existence of those ancient beings,
to what reasonable mind would it occur&mdash;especially at the
hour of sunset?
</p>

<p>
Immense silent world of stones&mdash;stones rounded by
centuries of rolling and wearing at the mercy of the
Alpine torrents&mdash;a long range of far-away mountains with
Mont Ventoux as their highest point, an atmosphere
thrilled with the sunlight, with that strange purity that
speaks of absolute solitude&mdash;such is La Crau.
</p>

<p>
If one is disposed to imagine that Provence is a land
all brilliancy and gaiety, as first impressions would
perhaps suggest, a sight of the Crau and the Camargue
is enough to correct the error.
</p>

<p>
When any place has gathered through long centuries
a certain kind of reputation, there will always be found
particular potent influences that hang about the spot.
And sometimes these influences are very mysterious and
hard to account for.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This is the case with the Crau. The reflections of heat,
and light from the immense body of stones may produce
peculiar conditions of atmosphere and ether and so affect
that delicately responsive instrument the human brain.
</p>

<p>
In any case, in its power of stirring and impressing it
is a place apart.
</p>

<p>
A strange story is told by Baring-Gould of his
experience when a child, of crossing the baking plain
with his father, on a hot summer's day. He was on the
box watching the post horses. As he looked, he "saw
a number of little men with peaked caps running about
the horses and clambering up them." His father sent
him inside the carriage out of the hot sun, but for some
time, he says, "I continued to see these dwarfs among
the pebbles of the Crau, jumping over the tufts of grass,
or careering along the road by the carriage side, making
faces at me."
</p>

<p>
However, one must not attribute a monopoly of the
power of evolving such visions to the Field of Pebbles,
for the author goes on to relate how in after years, one
of his boys, while picking gooseberries, "saw a little man
of his own height with a peaked cap, red jacket, and
green breeches."
</p>

<p>
Moreover, strange to say, the same thing happened
to his wife when a girl of thirteen, so that one cannot
account for the marvel by heredity, that convenient
explanation of mysteries. Sun on the head, the author
supposes, must have caused all these experiences.
</p>

<p>
"But why," he adds, "should the sun on the head
superinduce a vision of Kobolds? Is it because other
people have suffered from the sun that the fables of little
men, brownies, pixies, gnomes, fairies, is to be found
everywhere? Or&mdash;is it possible that there is such a little
creature only visible to man when he is subject to certain
influences?"

<p class="caption">ON THE VERGE OF LA CRAU.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
We first approached this forsaken region in the train,
when the sun was beginning to get low, and wonderful
tragic lights were showing along the western horizon.
The olives and the pleasant farmsteads had been left
behind, and we found ourselves rushing on through the
evening glow into a limitless desolation. And suddenly
there flashed past close to the train a tall, dark shadow
and a little station, and then another shadow and another,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
till presently the shadow grew continuous except for
recurrent flashes of light, pulsing steadily as the train
raced on; and we found that the line was bordered
on one side with an immense wall of cypresses, and
between their trunks one caught glimpses of the white
wilderness beyond. For miles this sombre rampart runs
on and on beside the line protecting it from the mistral
which sweeps with terrible violence across these huge
spaces. The stones are described by many writers as
gigantic, but they look not more than about a foot in
diameter in this southern part of the plain, and in the
neighbourhood of St. Martin-en-Crau they appear rather
smaller and of extraordinary uniformity of size and shape.
</p>

<p>
But not only is the eye amazed by this tremendous
extent of water-worn stones (there are really two other
lesser Craus beside the Crau d'Arles): the imagination
is startled by the extraordinary depth of this strange
deposit, an average of from ten to fifteen metres; that
is at the lowest estimate over thirty feet, and at the
highest forty-five feet.
</p>

<p>
Imagine that depth of vast pebbles being poured down
from the Alps over miles and miles of plains! No wonder
the ancient tribes called in the aid of their gods in trying
to account for the stupendous catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
Among the distant mountains&mdash;many miles away&mdash;in
the strange landscape of the Luberon range lies Varigoule,
the scene of the Provençal Sabat. Valmasque,
the Witch's Vale, was the home of the persecuted
Vaudois. Witches, wizards, dracs (or water spirits),
and a hundred other uncanny creatures have been associated
by the people for unnumbered centuries with these
gloomier scenes: rivers springing out of unknown sources,
black cliffs, fantastic pinnacles whose names belong to
forgotten tongues: Ligurian, Gallic, Phœnician, one
knows not what, bestowed one knows not when; perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
when Hercules fought the Ligurians on the Crau and
his father Jupiter came to his aid with a shower of
enormous stones.
</p>

<p>
Æschylus makes Prometheus direct the footsteps of
Hercules to the Crau, where he tells him he will encounter
the native Ligurians and be helpless in their hands for
want of a single stone, which the country cannot supply.
In this dilemma he will touch the pity of Jupiter who
will cover the sky with clouds and send down a hail
of stones with which Hercules can drive back the
Ligurian hosts.<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a>
</p>

<p>
The ancient Ligurian race of which one hears so
much, occupied the country from the Pyrenees to the
Arno in the seventh or eighth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and were not
subdued till the reign of Augustus, who raised the well-known
monument at La Turbie, near Monaco, to celebrate
his victory. As one of their great tribes, the Salyans,
had for their cities Marseilles, Tarascon, Arles, Glanum
(St. Remy), it is not improbable that the natives of
this district, now growing so familiar, were the
descendants of the Ligurians or Ligyens, "ce peuple
harmonieux," as they have been called. They are
thought to be of Asiatic origin, and are described as
a small, dark-haired people, open to all the arts, particularly
music, and "sensitive to all the delicacies of
life." They gave a high place to their women, who had
the <i>rôle</i> of arbitress in all large affairs and who have left
behind them many traditions of their "heroism and
largeness of soul." Perhaps it is to this "harmonious
people" that France and Italy owe their brilliant artistic
history.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
</p>

<p>
If one may not regard the ordinary man and woman
of the towns of Provence as the direct representatives
of this primitive people, they have surely left living
records in the peasants of the remoter nooks and corners
of Southern France.
</p>

<p>
In Languedoc, Provence, indeed everywhere in the
great regions of the Ligurians, notably on the hills of
the Riviera, one comes upon a curious brown-skinned,
flat-featured type, not "plain," as a modern face may
be plain from failure in harmonious development, but
merely roughly fashioned. It is a type not without a
harsh comeliness, a wholesome success in its own archaic
fashion.
</p>

<p>
The faces seem scarcely European. There is in them
a singular look of antiquity; something unfinished, half
animal (in the sense of unreflecting), with steady, open
gaze, not intent but unswerving, revealing very little
that we understand by "human nature." One seems to
be looking at human nature in the making.
</p>

<p>
These people live in little vales by a mountain stream,
in nooks in the hills; fauns or satyrs one might fancy
them in the twilight&mdash;cultivating a few olives and keeping
a few cocks and hens and perhaps a cow, and so living
as their ancestors must have lived for centuries while
the great tides of life and history were flowing and
flowing past them.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps this was the dusky race that the Greeks and
Romans actually took for satyrs, or divinities of the
woods, for the term "work like a satyr" is the Provençal
equivalent for "work like a nigger," and it is thought
likely, by some authorities, that the term thus became
embedded in the popular traditions.
</p>

<p>
There is a strange corroboration of the idea that in this
rough-hewn type we may really see the ancient inhabitants
of Gaul, the predecessors of the Gauls themselves, for near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
Aix was discovered among the remains of a prehistoric
village some primitive stone carving attributed to Ligurian
workmanship, and the features there so crudely wrought
are practically identical in type with those of the true
<i>gens du pays</i>.
</p>

<p>
Any one who visits the little grey towns that cap so
many mountain peaks of the Maritime Alps, will encounter
examples of this prehistoric face.
</p>

<p>
Without any reasonable doubt such people fought for
their lives and homes&mdash;probably caves and huts of mud
and reeds in the fastnesses of the hills&mdash;many and many
a time, and the tradition of their combat with Hercules
is probably the echo of some monster battle between
Greeks and Ligurians on the plain of the Crau.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Why any one should desire to visit the Crau puzzles
the gaiety-loving Provençal not a little, and that a traveller
should for that purpose deliberately make a railway
journey to a little, windy, solitary station beyond Arles,
where but few trains stop&mdash;that argued a form of madness
probably considered as peculiar to Britons.
</p>

<p>
At Arles unhesitating informants had insisted that
from St. Martin-en-Crau one could easily reach the Field
of Pebbles, and on arrival there I asked the porter in
which direction it lay. He stared, and referred me to the
stationmaster, a majestic creature in blue and buttons.
</p>

<p>
"La Crau? les cailloux?" Ah! no, there was no one
who could give me any information about them here.
"But at Miramas&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Miramas! But that was miles along the line!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Monsieur le Chef de Gare looked at me pityingly.
True, but he understood I was inquiring about the stones
of La Crau.
</p>

<p>
So I was&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
"Eh bien, il y a des entrepreneurs a Miramas&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Then I understood. He thought I wanted to enter
into negotiations for buying stones for building or other
purposes.
</p>

<p>
When at last he took in the situation he shook his head
and shrugged his shoulders as a French official shrugs
when he regards your case as at once foolish and hopeless.
</p>

<p>
To arrive <i>en pleine Crau</i> one must go at least five kilometres.
It did seem hopeless indeed, for even if disposed
for the lonely walk, there would not have been time to
go and return in time to catch the only reasonable train
back to Arles. I had made many efforts already to
accomplish this project, and all had failed through inaccurate
directions of this nature. Naturally there were
no excursion trains to the Crau. Still I could not resign
myself to failure. Was there no trap, no inn where I
could hire something to drive in? I didn't care what it
was.
</p>

<p>
This grand indifference seemed to strike an answering
spark. Well, there was a little <i>mas</i> (farm) over the way.
The farmer had an old dog-cart that he drove in; perhaps
I might make an arrangement with him.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur le Chef de Gare pointed to a barn opposite
where I found an old cart, the farmer, several labourers,
and a lot of dogs.
</p>

<p>
They all looked on during the interview, which ended
by the farmer's agreeing to drive me where I wanted to
go&mdash;<i>après tout c'était mon affaire</i>. So off we started, the
farmer himself driving and two of the dogs following
joyously.
</p>

<p>
Very exhilarating was our somewhat jolty progress
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
across the large level sunny district. It seemed more
hushed than any inhabited district I had ever visited; as
if it felt the presence of the great desert a few miles off.
There were none of the little events of the country; no
cattle looking over walls, no children along the roadside,
no coming and going about the farmsteads, of which there
were very few and those few singularly small and lifeless.
The trundle of the wheels and the sound of the horse's
hoofs on the road outlined themselves upon a blank sheet
of silence. It seemed unnatural; the more so as there
was everywhere such golden brightness.
</p>

<p>
The only scene of activity that we passed, soon after
leaving the farm, was a group of men cutting down some
ancient olive trees, and the farmer called out to them
something in Provençal, to which there were some
shouted replies, and all caps went off in a friendly way
to <i>le patron</i>.
</p>

<p>
He was a quiet, worthy sort of man, very little different
from an English farmer of the same condition. He was
not unwilling to answer questions, but it was curious how
he contrived to reply without conveying the slightest information,
a peculiarity, be it remarked, of the type that
is called "worthy."
</p>

<p>
If one asked, for instance, whether the land was owned
by the peasantry themselves in the district, or whether it
was in the hands of wealthy proprietors, he would flick
the point off a branch of bramble in the hedge, and say
with a shrug, implying that the inquiry was somewhat
trivial: "Oui, il y en a."
</p>

<p>
It was useless to press the matter further, for that
merely produced a still more effective barrier against the
inquiring mind.
</p>

<p>
It is a fact, however, that in many districts of the
South of France (contrary to the usual belief) the land is
by no means always held by the peasants.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Again and again, in reply to inquiries, I have been
informed that this or that stretch of country belonged to
Monsieur or le Baron So and So, who was "enormement
riche."
</p>

<p>
Questions about ancient customs were almost always
futile. No promptings could produce a description or
even a clear admission that such things existed. The
true native is most damping to archæological enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
The one thing he warms up about is the new village
pump, or the hideous crucifix in cast iron which the
municipality has just erected on some ancient stone
pedestal where for centuries the discarded, moss-stained,
prayer-assailed image used to stand, in all its pathetic
significance.
</p>

<p>
My friend seemed to know little or nothing about his
own surroundings, or perhaps he knew them so well and
so exclusively that he could not see that there was anything
to tell about them. Besides, he could not tell it;
that was the way <i>le bon Dieu</i> had made him.
</p>

<p>
Whenever we came to a very stony bit of land&mdash;and
there was plenty of it&mdash;he at once pointed it out. He
took it that my hobby was stones, and very insatiable in
that respect he must have thought me, for nothing
would satisfy my cravings in that direction short of the
unnumbered millions of the Crau!
</p>

<p>
He seemed a kind-hearted man, and fond of his dogs.
The illness of one poor beast through apparently incurable
eczema much concerned him. He had often been urged
to destroy the dog, but he never could bring himself to
put an end to "un aimi fidèle." The animal looked up
and wagged his tail, as if understanding he was being
talked about.
</p>

<p>
My offer to write down the name of a remedy (Jeye's
fluid) that had effected a cure in a similar case I knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
called forth something approaching animation in my
conductor for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Almost the only man-made object in the whole
journey was a dynamite factory with white glass retorts
full of the explosive, actually ranged in long rows by the
public roadside. It seemed a fitting industry for this
forlorn district.
</p>

<p>
Last winter snow had fallen on the retorts and broken
them in, and the dynamite had exploded. But still they
rested by the roadside!
</p>

<p>
Suppose there came along a shying horse or an unmanageable
motor? The farmer shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"That would be a bad business!"
</p>

<p>
In this much-managed Republic that was how they
managed things!
</p>

<p class="p2">
As we drew near our journey's end, the vegetation grew
sparser till there were only shrubs of diminishing size,
growing in harder and harder soil. Then the cart left
the road&mdash;this strange "morose route"&mdash;and we began
to drive over grass: a rough sort of waste land with
many pebbles; and before us was a great light such as
greets the traveller coming in sight of the sea. It was
the Crau!
</p>

<p>
"Nous y sommes," said the farmer, pulling up his
horse to allow me to get down, "nous sommes maintenant
en pleine Crau."
</p>

<p class="p2">
I knew now for certain where the silence came from
that had brooded over the country all the way!
</p>

<p class="p2">
He thinks he knows what silence is who has lived in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
some remote spot in the heart of the English country,
who has stood, on some breezeless evening, by the shores
of an inland lake, or alone on far-away moorlands when
the birds have gone to their rest and the night is coming
up over the sky.
</p>

<p>
But <i>that</i> is not silence!
</p>

<p>
In the woodlands there is the tremor of a leaf, not
perhaps quite heard, but not unknown to the finer consciousness;
by the lake-side the water noiselessly stirs
against the bank; on the moors the creatures are breathing
in their holes and hiding places, the tiny bells of
the heather ring an inaudible chime&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But on the Crau&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
To say that there is not a sound is meaningless.
There are strata upon strata of silence, deep as the
deep sea; one hesitates on the verge, half dreading to
advance.
</p>

<p>
Here at last is a realm untouched by human passion.
It belongs utterly to the kingdom of physical "Nature,"
Nature in her heaviest mood, without the smallest thrill
of manifested life or emotion.
</p>

<p>
To understand this to the full one must tramp over its
hard stones and feel its lonely breath in one's face.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Turning one's steps humanwards again, one hastens
with the eagerness of an exile to claim as dear friend and
brother the first, humblest creature, animal or human, for
sheer sympathy of the living with the living, for sheer
relief after the meeting face to face the cold white Spirit
of the Wilderness.

<p class="center">
ROSES OF PROVENCE
</p>

<p>
What is the mysterious force in life that always makes
it impossible to linger in any place where conditions are
entirely congenial? We can stay so easily and with so
much general approval in odious spots, among exasperating
companions. But let a charm attach to any
scene or circumstance and straightway every factor of
one's destiny flies into violent collision with every other
factor, so that immediate flight becomes necessary, to the
farthest limits of the railway system.
</p>

<p>
Only "le violence de notre étoile," or at any rate
of Barbara's "étoile," could drive us from these bright
regions; but then her star <i>was</i> very violent. Our
country clamoured for us. It would have seemed flattering
had we not known that it sprang chiefly from the
desire that consumes the majority of people to act
as sheep-dog towards wandering members of the community;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
an instinctive feeling that if they are "away"
it is high time that they should come back again.
</p>

<p>
Barbara announced that she must go in about a week
or ten days; and all that remained for us to do was to
make the most of her remaining time.
</p>

<p>
Our strange little mountains, the Alpilles, still held our
fancy. Why not go to the little town at their foot, St.
Remy, with its industry of seed culture? We had read
of its Roman monuments and of the cordon of flowers
which surround it in the blooming season.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</p>

<p>
It must be beautiful here in May when the vines are
yellow-green to the tips of their young fingers. But
greater beauty than now, at this late time, is scarcely
possible to believe in.
</p>

<p>
The plain is gold and brown, with splashes of crimson
where the sun shines through some eccentric spray of
vine-leaves passionately red beyond its fellows.
</p>

<p>
St. Remy is the ancient Glanum of the Romans, and
has memories not scholastic of Cæsar's Gallic Wars.
Along the passes of the Alpilles, Marius moved with
his army at that stirring moment which was to decide
whether the hordes of the Cimbri and the Teutons
were to overrun all Italy and take possession of the
Eternal City itself. So near a thing it was that the
barbarians insolently asked the Roman soldiers if they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
had any messages for their wives and sweethearts in
Rome, as they would soon be there.
</p>

<p>
Everything hung on the strategy of the Roman general,
and it is only on the scene of that great contest that one
realises what a desperate and universal moment it was.
</p>

<p>
Had the campaign of Marius ended otherwise than it
did&mdash;had he yielded an hour too soon to the impatience
of his soldiers to begin the fight&mdash;the whole course of
history would have been different in all probability, and
perhaps not one of us would have been born!
</p>

<p class="p2">
The railway from Tarascon to our little City of
Gardens brings one into
the very heart of the
country. The carriages
are so small&mdash;two-storied
though they are&mdash;that one
feels as if one were taking
a drive in a donkey-cart
or station fly, and more
than once we were almost
impelled to call out to our
driver to stop and let us
gather wild-flowers by the wayside. And the wayside
is so absurdly near. There is none of the dignified
aloofness of the ordinary train journey.
</p>

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By Joseph Pennell.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The same general features of the country are, of
course, as before, but now we are intimately among
its details: the vines, the low olive-bushes, the farmsteads,
the cypresses, the patches of cultivation, the
plantations of yellow canes rustling and swaying. And
ever we are nearing the Alpilles. The train stops dutifully
at a dozen little stations, where no one gets in or
out. They are scarcely more than sentry-boxes; sometimes
a mere frame filled in with the stalks of the reeds.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
Were it not that the mistral can blow through them, it
seems impossible that these trivialities could withstand
his lightest breath.
</p>

<p>
St. Remy, once the country seat of the Counts of
Provence, has no walls of stone, but four-square leafy
ramparts of plane-trees. From the door of the <i>Hôtel
de Provence</i> one may turn to the right or left and
blindly follow the avenues round the little town till
one returns to one's starting-point, where probably a
brown-eyed youth will still be grinding coffee beside
the footpath. There are almost no sounds in St. Remy,
for there are no vehicles except the hotel omnibus which
trundles to and from the station, marking the lapse
of time.
</p>

<p>
The visitors all, or nearly all, come with the same
intent: to negotiate with the growers of seeds, and, at
the proper season, they arrive in great numbers from
every part of the world, including America the ever-enterprising.
</p>

<p>
Pinks and carnations and lilies, and purple acres
of pansies with their texture of velvet; flowers and
flowers in multitudes, blooming and budding and blushing&mdash;this
is the sweet merchandise of St. Remy en Provence.
</p>

<p>
The hotel has the homely, spacious character of old-established
inns in country towns. One feels a sense of
comfort as one enters, and the courteous greeting of the
landlord and his wife confirms one's satisfaction. The
long, dark-papered <i>salle-à-manger</i> has a broad streak of
sunshine across the polished floor from an open window
which gives on to the regions at the back of the hotel.
The waiter hastens to shut this, but desists with a shrug
and a smile at our remonstrance. If we like to sit
in draughts and endanger our lives, after all it is our own
affair. He feels with Madame de Sévigné, "Mais ce sont
des Anglais!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The window allows one to pass out into a nondescript
territory where boots are cleaned, firewood is stacked, and
the omnibus is regularly put to bed and tucked in after
its day's work.
</p>

<p>
To the left, a magnificent plane-tree spreads golden
foliage far and wide, brimming up to our bedroom
windows just overhead. And a little further from the
house, on this side of a sombre row of cypresses, with an
ethereal view to the left of palest mountain peaks&mdash;a
Provençal rose garden!
</p>

<p>
"But gather, gather, Mesdames," invites our kind host,
"gather as many as you will." He smiles at our amazed
delight, and waves a hospitable hand towards the masses
of blossom, radiantly fresh and fair.
</p>

<p>
Roses of Provence!
</p>

<p>
The sun draws out the fragrance and shines through
the petals till they gleam like gemmed enamel. We
linger entranced.
</p>

<p>
In the narrow path we are elbow high in roses. And
everything seems to stand still and wait in the hot sun.
Nothing moves on. There is only a tiny floating back
and forwards of a thread of cobweb between rose and
rose; and very slowly now and again a broad swathe
of plane-foliage heaves up and down on a little swell of
air which the tree has all to itself in the shade-dappled
precincts that it rules.
</p>

<p>
Looking across the roses from this spot we can see the
rich tapestry of blossom against the cypresses, tall, grave
warders of the Garden of Pleasure.
</p>

<p>
And still nothing moves forward. The flies come out
and make drowsy, foolish noises in the warmth. But
they return upon their paths and make buzzing circuits.
A particular spasmodic burnished insect that darts
suddenly to a distance and then remains thunderstruck
before the heart of a flower, keeps on doing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
the same ridiculous thing all round the garden, and
only adds to the impression of changelessness. It is
as if the world had really come to a pause, and time
and trouble had ceased their eternal pulse-beat.
</p>

<p>
And we gather our roses&mdash;while we may.
</p>

<p>
"Mais Mesdames, vous n'avez choisi que les roses les
plus communes; tenez Mesdames." And Monsieur the
landlord plunges into the bushes and cuts bloom after
bloom of the most exquisite sorts: red and yellow and
creamy white, till his generous hand can grasp no more.
He stands smiling discreetly while we bury our faces in
the flowers, and hold them at arm's length to admire
them the more.
</p>

<p>
"Elles vous rendent heureuses, les roses, Mesdames,"
he says, with a little smile and a bow; "alors vous
rendez heureuses les roses&mdash;et votre serviteur."
</p>

<p>
We try to make a co-operative bow (bowing was not
Barbara's strong point), and to indicate as well as we can
that only in this delightful country had we ever met with
such lovely roses or such kind people.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The first part of the day was occupied in wandering
over the open country that surrounds this placid little
town of the Romans. The plain is wide&mdash;immense in
its spaces, marked with the inevitable walls of cypresses
and dotted with shrubs and farms as far as the eye can
follow.
</p>

<p>
The strange, almost grotesque outline of the Alpilles
closes in this view to the South, and between these
mountains and the town there are endless rough tracks
and paths among the hollows and risings of the land,
quaint cuttings in the soil which lead the eye to the blue
of the hills.
</p>

<p>
Here and there would be a small dwelling, here and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
there a field enclosed for pasture, but this was rare. The
greater part was wild, rough country, owing little to the
care of man.
</p>

<p>
In one of the highest spots of this singular district
stands a curious stone cross, called by the people <i>La
Croix de Vertu</i>, why it is impossible to discover. It
is a monolith supporting a small iron cross, which is
doubtless of much later date than its support.
</p>

<p>
It is approached from four sides and occupies the
highest ground at which the four paths meet.
</p>

<p>
A strange, little lonely mysterious monument, whereby,
doubtless, hangs many an ancient tale!
</p>

<p>
We spent the rest of the day in visiting the Roman
remains&mdash;two well-preserved relics of Imperial days&mdash;a
triumphal arch and a tall monument which is said to
have been built to celebrate the great victory of Marius
over the Teutons.
</p>

<p>
They stand lonely and singularly unspoiled, at the foot
of the Alpilles, and before them stretches a wide plain
over which the light is growing soft and warm, the few
shadows of olives and low bushes beginning to lengthen.
</p>

<p>
And we sit down on the dry grass near the monuments
and are silent.
</p>

<p>
The agitated figures on the bas-relief of the triumphal
edifice stand out well in the glowing light. They
are fighting and struggling in some unknown contest
which they take, poor things, so very seriously, and
which really matters so very little after all! The
broad, long lines of the landscape speak eloquently of
the folly of that old death-struggle. It is strange to
think of those stone warriors fighting on century after
century as the seasons go by, always there and always
fighting when the sun touches them in the morning,
when the white moon peers over the jagged outline of
the little mountains just behind, and finds them at it still!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
Do they not even rest when there is neither sun nor moon
but only a great wide darkness over the land and the
mountains are blotted out?
</p>

<p>
It seems as if there were a waking up rather than a
resting as the night approaches.
</p>

<p>
We linger till the air is dim and mysterious, and the
exquisite wreath of leaves on the archi-vault of the
triumphal arch begins to get blurred, clean-cut and fresh
though it is. But something seems to creep up out of
the earth, to swarm round out of the mountains till there
might be seen or felt a shadowy throng&mdash;inchoate presences
that stream through the arch and crowd round the
foot of the unresting monument.
</p>

<p>
Barbara judiciously looks at her watch. And we rise
and walk slowly back to our hotel along the white road,
silent, and perhaps rather sad.

CHAPTER XX
</p>

<p class="center">AN INN PARLOUR
</p>

<p>
After dinner&mdash;which by the way was of extraordinary
excellence&mdash;we were invited to the parlour of mine host,
and felt like travellers in some old romance on the eve of
antique adventures. Nothing antique, however, happened,
except, indeed, the odd gathering of the family and the
guests of the hotel, and the talk that went circling cheerfully
round the fire in the little dull-tinted room. The
dulness of colouring was the result of long use; everything
having faded into harmony and grown together
through long and affectionate association.
</p>

<p>
Besides Madame and a pretty niece who was staying
with her, there were two youths employed in the
seed industry, who lived in the town and came in every
evening for their dinner. They were on terms of friendly
intimacy with the host and hostess who evidently
regarded their office in other lights than that of mere
commercial enterprise. They looked upon their guests
as under their charge, and their desire was to minister
to their comfort and pleasure in every possible way.
Monsieur and one of the youths played draughts, Madame
sewed and chatted, and Mademoiselle, the niece, made
herself generally agreeable. Between the two youths
was a mild rivalry for her smiles. We, as strangers,
were treated with special courtesy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Madame and her husband did the honours of their
homely <i>salon</i> most gracefully. The conversation turned
on the Monuments of St. Remy, its objects of interest
which strangers come to see, and its excursions: Les
Baux above all, on the other side of the Alpilles.
</p>

<p>
"Une ville très ancienne, sculptée dans les rochers,
toute élevée au dessus de la vallée&mdash;mais une cité
vraiment remarquable, Mesdames. Vous devez certainment
y aller."
</p>

<p>
And we decided at once to do so, arranging to have a
trap to take us across the mountains on the following
morning.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile we gathered further information about St.
Remy itself. There is <i>La Maison de la Reine Jeanne</i>, in
which the family of the famous Mistral has lived for
generations. In the foundations were discovered the
bones of an elephant and various weapons, all supposed
to be relics of Hannibal's passage through the country at
the foot of the Alpilles.
</p>

<p>
The famous poet, however, does not live in this
historical home at St. Remy, but at Maillane, a little
village of the plain about seven kilometres distant. The
house, to which many a pious pilgrimage has been made,
is square and white and stands in a little shady garden
with a high wall and iron gate facing the village street.
Thanks to the poet and his colleagues the ancient costume
still lingers at Maillane and at St. Remy, and on Sundays
the women go to church in the soft, white fichu and
picturesque head-dress that one has learnt to associate
with the women of Arles. The Provençal type is characteristic;
dark eyes and hair, olive skin, and a singularly
fine carriage of the figure and head.
</p>

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mistral and his fellow Félibres have much to do
with the survival of art and old customs. One of this
little band of modern troubadours lives still, as we learn,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
in the house of his family at St. Remy, and Mistral (as
we have seen) is not far away across the plain, faithful
always to the land that he loves so deeply and labours so
hard to preserve in its ancient beauty, ancient faiths and
ancient language. I had afterwards the privilege of
visiting Mistral at Maillane and M. Girard and his wife
at St. Remy, and of hearing them speak with intense
enthusiasm and affection of the Provence that is passing
away. M. Girard's angry melancholy at the erasure of all
character and individuality from lands and peoples was
pathetic and impressive.
</p>

<p>
He exhibited his fine collection of ancient furniture,
crockery, pewter, and a thousand beautiful relics: among
them a splendid example of the "Crêche," that quaint
Provençal institution with which the children are made
happy every Christmas. It is a modelled representation
of the coming of the Magi, but on this root idea the
artists of Provence have grafted many additions. The
Virgin, beautifully sculptured and coloured, sits in a hilly
landscape and holds a sort of grand reception: Magi and
other distinguished visitors surround her, while shepherds,
merchants, publicans and sinners, varied by
ornate donkey-drivers and goatherds, are perched on
hill-tops among companionable windmills about their
own size; and peasants are lavishly distributed in very
green meadows in the vicinity; all congregated to offer
homage to the Madonna and the haloed Babe. The
<i>crêche</i> is reverently veiled with a curtain on ordinary
days, and its owner drew this aside and lighted the
candles to illumine the treasured heirloom which has
delighted so many generations ... and not alone of
children.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Our hostess of the Hôtel de Provence was learned about
the seed industry of St. Remy, and explained how ruthlessly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
every bloom is nipped off and prevented from seeding
if it does not answer truly to its type. That was how
the splendid flowers were achieved: viz., by a persistent
interference with the ordinary course of nature&mdash;a fact
which gives food for thought. Besides flowers, St.
Remy has some fine vegetables to boast of. I had often
noticed strange, unknown, gourd-like things, bright red
or yellow, in the shop windows. The <i>cornichon serpent</i>,
"ce légume extravagant," as somebody calls it, is said to
measure nearly two metres! But that immoderate object
we never saw.
</p>

<p class="p2">
We were out betimes next morning, in the rose-garden
which was glistening with dew. The Garden of Pleasure
truly, guarded by the mournful cypresses! That seemed
full of significance: the Roses of Pleasure sheltered by
those dark trees of Experience and Grief.
</p>

<p>
Burns sings that "pleasures are like poppies"; and so
perhaps they are, but there are some that are more like
roses&mdash;Roses of Provence!
</p>

<p>
They are the sort of pleasures of which that strange
<i>pot-pourri</i> that we call happiness is made. For surely
there <i>is</i> such a thing as happiness, though the science of
it is as hard to learn as any other; perhaps harder than
them all. Maybe it is necessary for us unteachable
mortals to have torn our way&mdash;bruised and bleeding&mdash;through
that black line of cypresses before we come in
sight of it.
</p>

<p>
If happiness is a will-o'-the-wisp, is it so because of
the eternal nature of things, or because, as Carlyle frankly
insists, men are mostly fools? Would not every desired
object assume an elusive character if as soon as we came in
touch with it, we flew off on the hunt for something else?
On this principle we must go through life unpossessed of
our own fortunes, strangers and pilgrims in our own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
kingdom. Barbara and I agreed that we would not forget
to gather the roses in our Provençal garden for the
illusive sake of other roses further afield.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In this little mediæval pleasure city it seemed natural
to speculate about the life of the Middle Ages, and we
wondered if part of the sad secret of those times lay in
that inveterate habit of the human mind to look for the
Earthly Paradise round the next corner. For then,
possibly, there was only a sage here and there who
had learnt the folly of it through long and footsore
wanderings in the desert which stretches unremittingly
between the traveller and his mirage Eden. The restless
barbarous manners of the age must have made the truth
harder to understand than it need be to us who have
many centuries of growing experience behind us, both as a
hereditary influence and as an object-lesson in the conduct
of life.
</p>

<p>
Incessant war and struggle, with no great results, but
only further struggle, further war as the fruit of the
lifelong contest: such was the mediæval life, and no
one saw its absurdity. Not a trace of the old Greek
spirit remained; not a vestige of the philosophies of the
East, except perhaps in the cloister, and even here, at
its best, the religion partook of the objective character
of the general life, and placed the site of "heaven" for
the saint, as the sinner placed his happiness,&mdash;round the
next corner.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In those mad, picturesque, mediæval days St. Remy
used to be the country retreat of the Counts of Provence.
They here retired from the excitements of their capital
at Aix, the learned little city a few leagues to the northeast,
beyond the Alpilles. We afterwards visited Aix,
and found another larger town of plane-avenues, more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
dignified, more important, but almost as silent and
forgotten as St. Remy itself. One could not but wonder
what the Counts had found of country joys at St. Remy
that they could not have commanded at the old city of
Sextius with its shady ways and gardens.
</p>

<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
But, in fact, the human mind seeks not merely a
change from excitement to repose; it demands a change
of scene and a change of thought-atmosphere for its
own sake.
</p>

<p>
During the whole of our stay at St. Remy we lived in
an atmosphere of roses. We could not gather enough
of them to please our host; and we used to have great
bunches in our rooms placed on the window-sill, so that
the sunlight filtered through their petals; and over them
we could see the garden of their birth and the pale
mountains beyond. Our very dreams were of roses and
rose-gardens!
</p>

<p>
One evening, inspired by their loveliness, I arranged a
wreath of them in Barbara's hair, added a creamy shawl
flowing to her feet, and stood back to admire the result.
It was something to be proud of! Our dull, discreet
<i>régime</i> of ladylike nonentities had disappeared, and there
was the poetry, the unapologetic grace of the classic
world.
</p>

<p>
Barbara rose to try to see herself in the minute mirror.
</p>

<p>
She gasped in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"No, no! you <i>dare</i> to take it off! There are some
more roses to come yet." (The victim made a comic
face of resignation.) "I want <i>profusion</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>do</i>!" said Barbara, sitting down to laugh. "Am
I to wear this costume when we go to Les Baux to-morrow?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"It depends on the weather."
</p>

<p>
But, alas! as soon as active opposition was withdrawn,
Barbara removed the improvised costume, took the roses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
out of her hair and the vision of the ancient world faded
away. When we went down to dinner we both of us had
on our sombre prison garments.
</p>

<p>
And though Barbara laughed, I knew that the world
was a sadder and a drearier place because of it!

CHAPTER XXI
</p>

<p class="center">LES BAUX
</p>

<p>
In all Provence, perhaps in all Europe, there is no more
astonishing relic of mediæval life than that "crater of a
feudal volcano" Les Baux,<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> a veritable eagle's nest of a
city in one of the wildest and highest points of the
Alpilles. It is a morning's drive from St. Remy across
the little range to its steep southern side.
</p>

<p>
We plunge straight into their heart and begin to
mount by gradual windings through little valleys, arid
and lonely. Dwarf oak, lavender and rosemary make
their only covering. But for their grey vesture one might
imagine oneself in some valley of the moon, wandering
dream-bound in a dead world. The limestone vales
have something of the character of the lunar landscape:
a look of death succeeding violent and frenzied life,
which gives to the airless, riverless valleys of our
satellite their unbearable desolation. It might have been
fancy, but it seemed that in the Alpilles there was not a
living thing; neither beast nor bird nor insect.
</p>

<p>
As we ascended, the landscape grew stranger and more
tragic. The walls of rock closed in upon us, then fell
back, breaking up into chasms, crags, pinnacles. The
lavender and aromatic plants no longer climbed the sides
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
of the defiles; they carpeted the ground and sent a sharp
fragrance into the air. The passes would widen again
more liberally into battlemented gorges from which great
solitary boulders and peninsulas rose out of the sea of
lavender. Here and there this fragrant sea seemed to
have splashed up against the rock-face, for little grey
bushes would cling for dear life to some cleft or cranny
far up the heights; sometimes on the very summit. As
one follows the road it seems as if the heavily overhanging
crags must come crashing down on one's head. What
prevents it, I fail to this day to understand.
</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The whole place gives the impression of having been
fashioned in some gloomy dream.
</p>

<p>
Every turn brings new and monstrous forms into view;
the fantastic handiwork of earth's inner fires, patient
modellings of the sun and wind. One thinks of the busy
coming and going along these "footprints of the earthquake"
in troubadour days, when knights and nobles
flocked to the famous little court of the Alpilles, and the
fame of the beautiful Passe Rose (Cecilia des Baux)
brought troops of admirers from the ends of the earth&mdash;kings,
princes, jongleurs, troubadours. Many a figure
well known to history&mdash;the exiled Dante among them&mdash;has
passed along these gorges. The Princes of Les Baux
owned seventy-nine bourgs and had a finger in half the
intrigues of Europe; a barbaric race, probably descendants
of the ancient Ligurians, with wild mountain blood in
their veins.
</p>

<p>
Further on, the valleys widen, and we see large oblong
holes hollowed out of the creamy limestone, sometimes
at regular intervals, producing an effect of arcades in the
rock. Still further on we come upon majestic Assyrian-like
portals, narrowing to the top in true archaic fashion
and giving ingress to dark vestibules exciting to the
fancy. They might well have been the entry to some
subterranean Aladdin's palace whose gardens and miraculous
orchards grow emeralds and diamonds as cherries
grow in Kent. It was quite surprising to find that these
grandiose excavations were the work of mere modern
quarrymen still engaged in the prehistoric industry.
Fine groups of horses and big carts and labourers before
the Assyrian entrances had an effect curiously ancient
and majestic. There was a time when the men of the
Stone Age cut just such galleries and holes far up in
the rocks at Les Baux and dwelt there like a flock of
jackdaws, high above the hazard of attack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is asserted by the learned that the city, in fact,
dates from the Stone Age, being inhabited by generation
after generation of wild peoples, till gradually the
dwellings were adapted to less uncivilised needs and added
to by further sculpturing and excavation and by masonry
whose material was hewn from the surrounding limestone.
</p>

<p>
In the city is a small museum containing many Stone
Age implements.
</p>

<p>
It is indeed a place of strange memories.
</p>

<p>
In one of the tombs of the principal church was
discovered the perfectly preserved body of a young
woman with a mass of golden hair. The body crumbled
to dust almost immediately, but the innkeeper took
possession of the beautiful tresses, and called his inn
in its honour, <i>à la Chevelure d'Or</i>.
</p>

<p>
Poor golden hair, it has set many a poet singing and
vielle twanging in its day!
</p>

<p>
We have been wending our way steadily upward across
a region that grows wider and more sweeping in its contours.
The road rounds a corner. Suddenly we feel the
wind in our faces and a blaze of light.
</p>

<p>
There is an exclamation, and then silence.
</p>

<p>
The carriage has stopped on the highest point of the
pass just where the road has been cut through the low
rock, and the driver points with his whip across a vast
grey cauldron of a valley to a sort of shelving plateau
high up on the shoulder of the opposite cliffs.
</p>

<p>
"Voilà Les Baux!"
</p>

<p class="p2">
The stupendous scene is spread out before us, wild
and silent. The wind from the Crau to the south
continues to blow through the cut in the rock; the sun
glares down full upon the mysterious rock-city and lays
bare the desolation of the valley.
</p>

<p>
Behind us a few sounds rise from the quarries, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
there is otherwise that perfect silence of high places
which seems to brood and wait, eternally patient.
</p>

<p>
This is the spot which is said to have furnished Dante
with the scenery of his infernal regions, and the mind
at once accepts the tradition, so gloomily grand, so
instinct with motionless despair is the scene.
</p>

<p>
Beyond measure extraordinary the aspect of that
cluster of roofs and walls scarcely to be distinguished
from the crags and escarpments out of which they
grow&mdash;"window and vault and hall" fashioned in the
living rock. Truly, as Madame our hostess had said,
"une ville remarquable"!
</p>

<p>
The eye slowly learns to recognise the masonry among
the natural architecture, to separate the fantastic limestone
surfaces from broken dwellings and fallen towers.
</p>

<p>
The city, once containing about eight thousand inhabitants,
is now reduced to about a dozen or so, and these
all live at the entrance to the town on the ascending road
from the valley by which the traveller from the mountains
must approach this grim little court of mediæval princes.
The road is comparatively new, for it cuts through some
of the great houses, and high up above us as we pass, we
see the columns and frieze of a fine stone mantelpiece
overhanging the road, evidently belonging to some
seigneurial dwelling. Perhaps it was here that the
lady of the golden hair passed her tumultuous life&mdash;it
could scarcely have been peaceful at that time, in that
place&mdash;with that hair!
</p>

<p>
A few silent inhabitants watch us as we go by. A cat
peers suspiciously over a wall of which the roof has fallen
in; a mongrel hunts for garbage in a rubbish heap in a
windowless mansion.
</p>

<p>
Before the <i>Chevelure d'Or</i><a name='FA_22' id='FA_22' href='#FN_22' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a> there is a little group of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
men. Here the trap is put up and we set forth on foot
up the steep main street of this "mediæval Pompeii."
</p>

<p>
The whole place is built on the shelving shoulder of
the cliff; a sloping ledge whence one might expect the
town to slip down at any moment into the cauldron-valley;
just as from time to time great fragments of
rock have evidently rolled down to eternal oblivion.
</p>

<p>
The impression of universal greyness strengthens as
we move upwards through the silent streets: grey walls,
grey tiles, grey paving stones and grey escarpments
above, on whose highest summit stands the rock-excavated
castle, now apparently inaccessible except to
adventurous birds&mdash;or, perhaps, the ghosts of the Princes
of Les Baux who for their crimes are unable to rest in
their graves.
</p>

<p>
We clamber up and down the ruinous higher part of
the town, among those pathetic rectangles of masonry
open to the sky where human life throbbed so eagerly a
little while ago; we mount some perilous-looking steps
on the cliff-side, in hopes of reaching the castle, but find
ourselves emerging in mid-air upon the edge of the
plateau overlooking from an appalling height the windy
spaces of the Crau.
</p>

<p>
The mountains run sheer to the plain. It is exciting
to stand on that great altitude which commands the
stony desert towards Arles and the mouths of the Rhone.
It has something of the character of the scene from the
Appian Way looking towards Ostia and the mouths of
the Tiber. The approach to Les Baux from Arles is in
some respects more impressive than the route from
St. Remy, for then the whole immense height of the
cliffs is visible from the level of the plain. On one of
the little heights that rise here and there on this plain
stands the windmill of Daudet, which gives the title to
his famous <i>Lettres de Mon Moulin</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
</p>

<p>
If we stand on the highest point of the city, the
eye can run along the line of the Alpilles. Another
little wave of hills sweeps forward on to the plain
precisely as the smaller ocean waves go curling in on
the shore, followed by the foaming line of breakers.
The Alpilles seem, indeed, to be breaking on the shore
of the Crau like the billows of a great sea.
</p>

<p>
A pathway perilously near the edge of the cliff fails to
help us to approach that strange castle from which we
are still separated by many feet of sheer rock.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
As we stand looking across the chasm at the stronghold,
its position seems to invest it with additional
mystery and a solitude almost horrible.
</p>

<p>
An evil shadow hangs about it, and yet there is but
little of the building touched by visible shades at this
magnificent moment of a Provençal day. A shadow
that no sunshine can dispel surely haunts the fortress of
Les Baux. For a second, in the hot glare, fancy plays
one a trick, and there seems to be floating from the
summit the blood-red banner which the princes used to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
unfurl on days of combat, when the air rang with the
strange battle-cry of the house: "Au hazard Balthazar!"
</p>

<p>
They claimed descent from Balthazar, one of the Magi
who visited the new-born Christ in the manger, and a
six-rayed star was the device of the family.
</p>

<p>
Their association with Christianity was certainly not
of a very intimate kind. They were a blind, blood-stained
race, believing in violence and retaliation as the
one and only means of grace in this world and troubling
themselves, till the moment of death, very little about
the next. They generally reaped as they had sown;
feared, hated, and often dying deaths as terrible as those
which they had inflicted on their victims.
</p>

<p>
It is thought probable that the Princes of Les Baux
were descended from the Visigoths who settled in Arles
in the fifth century. There is a vast and ancient work
by "Le Sieur de Bouche, Docteur en Theologie," printed
at Aix-en-Provence in the 17th century. In the section
treating of the Visigothic Kingdoms the author gives an
account of their King Euric and the events in Provence
of the year 475.
</p>

<p>
"L'on croit communement," he says, "que c'est en ce
temps que le chateau de la Ville de Baux en Provence a
esté bâty et qu'il a tiré son nom de quelque illustre et
grand Seigneur Visigoth et Prince de la Maison Royale,
laquelle était de la famille des <i>Batthes</i>...."
</p>

<p>
From the fifth to the fifteenth century the line can
be traced. At the end of that era Charles III. of
France died, and then the barony of Les Baux with
the whole county of Provence, was united to the crown
of France. Louis XIII. gave it to the Grimaldi who
came in state each year from Monaco, to take up their
abode here; but they finally had to give it back to the
crown.

<p>
It was surprising to find the remains of a hospital
on the plateau above the city, with the niches visible for
the beds of the patients; so surprising, indeed, that one
is almost tempted to set learned authority at defiance.
Perhaps, however, with all the brawls and tournaments
of those amazing times, some such place was really
necessary for repairing damaged knights.
</p>

<p>
As one looks downwards from this altitude, the city
presents a strange aspect indeed. The grey buildings are
flung together among the boulders, a tumultuous mass of
human and natural handiwork. Truly
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"The wind of ruin has passed this way."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Under the castle rock are the remains of a magnificent
banqueting-hall, with caissoned vaulting like that of the
Basilica of Constantine at Rome.
</p>

<p>
The Romans had been even at Les Baux, and it
was they who built the walls which still here and
there cling giddily to the sheer edge of the rock. But
they had many successors. A Saracen tower stands
shoulder to shoulder with Christian churches, and everywhere
are signs of the great feudal era, with its religious
enthusiasm, its din and its warfare.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Princes, who were Counts of Orange as
well as Seigneurs of this little kingdom in the sky, there
were powerful families in Les Baux.
</p>

<p>
The house of the Porcelets, one of the greatest, not
only of the city, but of Provence, was nicknamed by
King René, <i>Grandeur des Porcelets</i>. The Princes he
called <i>Inconstánce des Baux</i>.
</p>

<p>
Out of the stern soil blossomed many a beautiful and
accomplished lady, famed in troubadour song.
</p>

<p>
Berengaria des Baux was celebrated by the luckless
Guilhelm de Cabestaing. Ranebaude inspired the world-famous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
Sordel; the charms of Cecilia, the beautiful Passe
Rose, as we know, kept half the troubadours of France
busy with vielle and lute; and there were Étienette,
Clairette, and a host of others whose true history one
would give much to know.

CHAPTER XXII
</p>

<p class="center">RAIMBAUT DE VACQUEIRAS AND GUILHELM DES BAUX
</p>

<p>
There is a particular stately house off the main street
that suggested itself as the house of the golden-haired
lady of Les Baux. Her burial place pointed to her
having belonged to a family of importance. She was
probably the wife of some tempestuous seigneur, and her
life, cut short so early, had doubtless been one of storm
and peril.
</p>

<p>
We were filled with an immense desire to know more
of her, and as we piled conjecture on conjecture, she
gradually assumed a definite form and personality, and
we felt towards her a sort of baffled sympathy.
</p>

<p>
We called her Alazais, for that name had pursued us
since we began to interest ourselves in the annals of
Provençal chivalry.
</p>

<p>
She was graceful, delicately fashioned, with a certain
reserved strength in the courtesy of her manner, and her
eyes&mdash;Barbara and I were disposed to part company
about her eyes, one leaning to blue, the other to brown;
so we split the difference, and Alazais received large
pathetic eyes of hazel.
</p>

<p class="p2">
We sit down on the parched hill-side by a heap of
stones, and let the genius of the place work its spells.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
And busily it begins to weave as the afternoon light
throws its glamour over the grey of rock and ruin, while
a little wind comes up from the Crau and plays across
the grass.
</p>

<p>
Raimbaut de Vacqueiras&mdash;Guilhelm des Baux&mdash;the
mere names of these two strong personalities seem almost
to summon them to their old haunts. Fancy kindles
with this glowing sun and this tremendous scene; the
forlorn city begins to stir and breathe, and then suddenly&mdash;some
distant sounds from below seem strangely like
the clatter of horses' hoofs&mdash;a twelfth-century cavalcade
on its way to the castle!
</p>

<p>
And there are voices. They come up faintly through
the sunshine, the voices of phantom riders who are
hastening up the steep incline.
</p>

<p>
If at this precise moment Guilhelm des Baux and his
troubadour friend with their followers are not where
they seem to be, that is a mere incident of Time, and
what is Time? An unreality, a mode of human thought.
And so the insistent sense of the gay procession is not
entirely a dream!
</p>

<p>
Certainly it is insistent! The clatter stops half way
at the little <i>Place</i> in front of the church of St. Vincent,
and there some of the company appear to go up the hill
to the fortress.
</p>

<p>
One instinctively listens. Are they exchanging parting
words or jests with one of their number who stays
behind? Perhaps Alazais herself is leaving or entering
her prison of a home and the gallant troubadour has
knelt to kiss her hand. It would be all in the day's work
of those times.
</p>

<p>
Possibly Raimbaut de Vacqueiras was seriously in love
with her. One may be allowed the supposition.
</p>

<p>
We half shrink from it, however, when it comes to the
point, for it would have meant so tragic a story.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
</p>

<p>
If it was not one of the Princes of Les Baux who
served up the heart of her troubadour-lover, Guilhelm de
Cabestaing,<a name='FA_23' id='FA_23' href='#FN_23' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a> as a dish to his wife, it was quite in their
most approved manner.
</p>

<p>
The luckless wife having, all unconscious, tasted of the
dish, her lord informed her what it was and asked her
how she liked it.
</p>

<p>
"I like it so well," she replied, "that henceforth I will
taste no other," and she flung herself headlong from the
castle window.
</p>

<p>
The horror of the tale lingers in the thoughts even as
they turn to other things: to the figure of the lady herself
leaning over the parapet of the little platform that
hangs over the valley; to the scene in the castle after
the tournament when the gay company has gathered in
the hall, and there is singing and playing of the vielle
and verse-making and dance; to the love-songs of
Raimbaut, thrilling and sweet above those of other
troubadours. He was but too fitted to attract: handsome,
courtly, quick-witted, warm-hearted, a warrior
poet, a knight and a singer.
</p>

<p>
Our poor heroine had no chance! One can see her in
the splendid barbaric hall, among the throng. White
was her <i>bliaut</i>, or robe, finely embroidered in gold, and
her long mantle was fastened to the shoulder with a clasp
of sardonyx.
</p>

<p>
It was not merely the beautiful dress, but the noble
manner of wearing it that counted in those strange little
courts of the Middle Ages. If the life was wild and
terrible, at least it had an exquisite and gracious
side.
</p>

<p>
One can picture Raimbaut, too, as he hastens to greet
Alazais; one can see her smile of welcome, grave and
gracious, half ceremonious, half encouraging.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And then the scene grows clearer and more realistic,
for we come upon a piece of solid history.
</p>

<p>
Between Raimbaut and his famous patron, Guilhelm
des Baux, many little disagreements had disturbed of
late the long friendship. Raimbaut, accustomed to ride
and fight and make verses by his friend's side, had
perhaps presumed upon the intimacy, and once he went
so far as to rally the Prince upon a recent incident that
had amused the district.
</p>

<p>
His Highness had been casually ravaging the estates
of his neighbour, Count Aimar de Valence, and one day
when he was on the Rhone in a small boat, some
fishermen caught him and he had to pay a large ransom
to Count Aimar, and be ridiculed into the bargain by
Gui di Cavaillon, whose tenso on the subject was taken
up and sung by all Provence. For notwithstanding the
new sentiment obligatory on all noble and knightly
persons, the men and women of the twelfth century
had by no means escaped from the base clutches of the
ancient <i>régime</i> whence they sprang, and to them the
misadventure and mortification of a neighbour seemed
exquisitely funny.
</p>

<p>
Even Raimbaut's sense of humour had not advanced
beyond that primitive stage.
</p>

<p>
His jests made the Prince very angry, and a quarrel
arose between the two which overthrew once and for all
their affectionate relations.
</p>

<p>
Then Raimbaut knew that the end had come to this
era of his life, and that he must go forth to seek his
fortunes anew.
</p>

<p>
And Alazais, in whose honour he had made such innumerable
verses? He must leave her too&mdash;love and
friendship had come to naught at one blow.
</p>

<p>
How beautiful she had looked in her white robes&mdash;perhaps
there had been something in her glance that had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
made him forget consequences&mdash;everything&mdash;except&mdash;what
folly it was!
</p>

<p>
Quick, pen and paper! A <i>canson</i> had darted into his
head. Farewell to joy and Alazais! Such a tribute was
only expected and fitting whatever might be his real
sentiments.
</p>

<p>
Raimbaut had got well into the third stanza, and the
lady's hair had been compared to six different resplendent
objects, when he was summoned to take part in the
events of the evening.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Mary!" cries the poet, "can a man not be
left in peace while he writes a <i>canson</i> to his lady?"
</p>

<p>
He goes muttering imprecations on idle folk who
cannot even pursue their idling without the help of busy
people.
</p>

<p>
Les Baux is among the places to which is attributed
one of the most famous of the Courts of Love, and to
this tribunal one may imagine the troubadour wending his
way through the crowds who are parading the streets,
singing and dancing the mouresca, their ancient Saracenic
dance, drifted westward from the mountains of the Moors.
</p>

<p>
Raimbaut is greeted with reproaches for his tardy
arrival. The business of the Court is in full swing:
gracious ladies and courtly knights are judging compositions
according to the rules of minstrelsy, discussing
nice points of honour and conduct, burning questions
concerning the purity and preservation of the language,
the rights and duties of the love-lorn.
</p>

<p>
"Is it better to have wisdom or to be irresistible with
the ladies?" is one of the recorded subjects.
</p>

<p>
"Who loves the more, he that is broken by his lady's
coldness, or he that is stimulated thereby to distinguish
himself the more?"
</p>

<p>
"Which is harder to bear, debt or love-sickness?"<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The jury look in vain to Raimbaut for his usual
brilliant judgments. Alazais, we may imagine, had
guessed the cause of his silence.
</p>

<p>
And she knows her own fate as she sits there, beautiful
and calm; perhaps accepting it as the will of heaven;
perhaps struggling desperately against the thought that
the troubadour would go forth into the world and quickly
fill the place of love in his heart&mdash;perhaps with another
love!
</p>

<p>
"Come, Raimbaut, what is your opinion?" cries one
of the young men, "You were not wont to be so
moody."
</p>

<p>
It had to be explained to him that they were discussing
the pains and penalties of love, and whether after
all it did not offer too much grief and longing and too
little reward to make it worth the while of a reasonable
being; the proposition of a truly bold spirit in a mediæval
Court of Love!
</p>

<p>
Raimbaut's reply is recorded in the history of his life:
"A man forges cold iron who thinks he can make a gain
without a loss."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he looked back to the scene of his boyhood,
the little town of Vacqueiras across the mountains, and
recognised how he had enlarged his world by coming
here and how he had so lost things dear to him, never to
be regained.
</p>

<p>
And now there was to be another gain&mdash;and another
loss.
</p>

<p>
One seems to see him in close debate with himself
as to what he should do. From the little house at
Vacqueiras he used to gaze on the grey towers of Les
Baux on the heights and dream of it as a goal beyond
which no sane hopes could wander.
</p>

<p>
Now, from the farthest point of the windy tableland
above the Crau he can see, or almost see, more than one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
famous city where he would be welcome. Aix, the stately
little home of learning with its hot springs dear to the
Romans, had still to wait for two centuries for its good
genius, King René, and suggested few possibilities to
the troubadour.
</p>

<p>
To the south lay Arles and Marseilles. Count Barral
of Marseilles would make a merry and an easy-going
patron; but there was an obstacle in that direction....
Just a little this side of Arles, in the extreme corner of
the Camargue, he catches sight of a faint outline which
he knows to be the church of Our Lady of the Marsh,
Ste. Maria de la Mar, "Les Saintes Maries," as it is
now called throughout Provence, and down on his knees
goes the warrior poet and says a prayer to the Blessed
Three, begging that they may be favourable to him in
the decisive step he is about to take, and that they will
direct his choice.
</p>

<p>
And now he has to wrench himself from the present
scenes and to make his many farewells, one among
them hard indeed to face.
</p>

<p>
Yet perhaps it was best he should go. There had been
gruesome tragedies at Les Baux&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
The day of departure could not be long delayed; the
Prince was relentless.
</p>

<p>
Just one glimpse of a beautiful, haunting face as
Raimbaut rides past the sombre palace where the lady
of his heart lives a life which a woman of to-day would
deem that of a condemned prisoner.
</p>

<p>
She stands at the open door among a lively group who
have collected to see him pass, as indeed all the people
of Les Baux are waiting to bid their beloved champion
and singer God-speed.
</p>

<p>
He uncovers his head, and Alazais acknowledges his
salute with the rest. And suddenly Raimbaut's heart
gives a leap, for he knows what he did not know before!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
But the cavalcade goes on down the street, and he rides
on to his fate.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Long, pensive shadows of the ruins are stealthily
gaining upon the golden light on the grass when we
begin to descend to the lower town. The main street,
down which Raimbaut de Vacqueiras seems to have
passed but a moment ago, is horribly silent, and the city
spreads its desolation upwards to the sinister castle&mdash;where
no blood-red banner is now flying.
</p>

<p>
We go on to the platform in front of the church of
St. Vincent, and stand looking over the parapet. The
gloomy vale below is filled with the mysteries of
twilight.
</p>

<p>
From this point one could watch those who go and
come to the city from the side of the mountains, for they
must emerge from or pass through the Gate of the Rocks
on whose threshold we ourselves had our first sight of
Les Baux that afternoon. Even as we look we can discern
a small speck against the limestone&mdash;exactly so
must the figure of Raimbaut have appeared to any eye
that watched him from this balcony of rock. Did not
Alazais so watch? And did he not turn and take one
last long look at the city he was leaving? Presently, as
she gazes (as we now gaze), there is no longer a black
speck against the white; the valley is empty&mdash;and a
faint breath of wind comes down it like a sigh.
</p>

<p>
And presently the sun begins to approach the edge of
the cauldron, and the taller buildings take on a tint of
vivid rose colour. How that golden hair must have
flamed up into glory if its owner watched there on such
an evening!

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' name='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We had visited her place of burial in the church behind
us; a sad, silent spot that might have supplied a text for
many a solemn sermon.
</p>

<p>
Mouldering walls and an empty grave. But they
breathed forth no solemnities to us, or at least no gloomy
ones. Rather they whispered of the mystery and power
of life and passion; of things potent, creative, immortal.
</p>

<p>
Nor could we believe that the vivid consciousness of
self and soul in that being to whom we sent our thoughts
could be less enduring than the mere echo of her words
and deeds in a universe where not a breath in the air or
a tremor of the ether can ever be truly lost.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible not to speculate further regarding
the real self of the woman as distinct from the self
which reflected the world of the twelfth century.
What that world expected of her we know, and so
we know a very large part of the reality, for the
emotions of most of us are the product of this eternal
outside suggestion.
</p>

<p>
But there is sometimes&mdash;perhaps always&mdash;deep down
in the being, a hidden spot that acknowledges no such
dictation; and here would spring up yearnings and
criticisms, revolts and despairs, while the wife of the
feudal seigneur punctually and uncomplainingly fulfilled
the demands of her position.
</p>

<p>
Did she ever, even for a moment, see the grim reality
of that position, or was it hidden from her eyes by tradition,
habit, by the little palliatives and privileges which
her power as a woman and a beautiful woman, would win
for her at this auspicious moment of new-born homage
for her sex?
</p>

<p>
It is not at all unlikely that some inkling of the strange
situation would drift across the consciousness now and
again, for it is just at the moment when a burden grows
a little less overwhelming that the bearer begins to cry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' name='Page_333' href='#Page_333'>333</a></span>
out against its oppression. Before then he has no breath
with which to cry!
</p>

<p>
Personal trouble and the sting of unhappy love might
have stirred momentary feelings that would link our
heroine of the golden hair with her sisters of future
generations. It is unthinkable that such feelings were
never in the hearts of women, in some form or other, in
the days of their darkest captivity.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, as she watched the troubadour riding forth
into the world, she rebelled against her task of eternal
waiting and submitting; against the all-extensive claims
made upon her as part and parcel of her husband's estate
and dignity: for her position in this respect was made
clear enough when he threateningly commended to her
vigilance the duty of safeguarding his name and the
"honour" of his house on pain of punishment such as
only a mediæval seigneur could devise.
</p>

<p>
Called to account for every act and word, admonished
like a child&mdash;and often in the tone used to the hounds
after a bad day's sport&mdash;not the most secret emotion of
her heart legitimately her own&mdash;body and soul the
property of her lord and his all-important family: her
life was one long reminder of the humiliating facts.
Was she tired of being warder of her own prison?
Even the hounds were not that! Was she sick of this
strange stewardship of herself as the property of
another? Must she remain for ever shut away from
ambitions, passions, hopes? Was she never to know
what love and loyalty as between free human souls
meant? Was she never&mdash;fool, fool that she was&mdash;&mdash;?
</p>

<p class="p2">
Some interruption occurred here, and Alazais ceased to
soliloquise.
</p>

<p>
Barbara said that there was really no need to address
as "fool, fool" the entirely sensible-looking nun who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>334</a></span>
emerged from the church of St. Vincent, with her Mass-book
in her hand.
</p>

<p>
The apparition of a creature of flesh and blood in this
strange place was almost startling, and it brought back
considerations of time and place and other delusive
modes of human thought. There was dinner to be considered&mdash;delusive
but necessary as delusions are;&mdash;in
short, the hour of departure had struck.
</p>

<p>
We turned slowly, reluctantly from the parapet, thinking
of Raimbaut de Vacqueiras as he rode away to his
new destiny, his wanderings from court to court, his
ardent love-affairs at Montferrat, his joys and great
sorrows, till at last wearied with misunderstandings,
disappointments, and saddened with the restless trouble
of his life, he joined the Crusades and died fighting
against the Saracens.
</p>

<p>
The home of Alazais looked more shadowy and mournful
than ever as we passed it on our downward way.

CHAPTER XXIII
</p>

<p class="center">THE SORCERESS OF THE ALPILLES
</p>

<p>
Music in a dead city!
</p>

<p>
We stopped abruptly. Out of the deepening stillness
there grew slowly, solemnly, the muffled, mournful
trembling of an organ issuing from the closed doors
of the church on the platform. The sound swelled,
ebbed, fell into low troubled mutterings, then swelled
again; never was any strain more plaintive, solitary
shadowed: all in subdued undertone, but heart-breaking.
</p>

<p>
Surely a human soul despairing and unable to find
expression!
</p>

<p>
In this wild scene it was unearthly in its intensity of
mournfulness. Looking back we saw the figure of a nun
crossing the space from the house of the Porcelets to
enter the church, and as the doors opened, the sound
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
poured out in fuller volume, but always in that strange,
tense undertone.
</p>

<p>
The city seemed to be steeped in melancholy, as if a
grey mist of grief had fallen upon it.
</p>

<p class="p2">
We commenced our homeward journey on foot, making
a little circuit to visit the "Pavillon de la Reine Jeanne"
in the gorge below, leaving our vehicle to follow.
</p>

<p>
La Reine Jeanne was the famous and beautiful Queen
Joan of Naples, heiress of Provence, whose father on his
death-bed counselled her to hand the country over to the
Pope, then at Avignon. He in his turn bestowed it on
the Count of Anjou, and thus Provence came to belong
to that powerful family.
</p>

<p>
The Queen is said to have often visited Les Baux,
and to have held Courts of Love and various revelries in
the now weed-grown enclosure where the Pavilion sadly
stands in the corner of what was once a garden; a fine,
highly-bred little piece of architecture well fitted for its
purpose.
</p>

<p>
On our way to rejoin our trap we were overtaken by
two wayfarers: a young man and woman somewhat
poorly clad and carrying bundles. They were looking
about them intelligently as if interested in the scene.
</p>

<p>
The man's bundle was evidently a musical instrument,
and as they came nearer we heard snatches of song, sometimes
gay, sometimes sad. The man pointed to Les
Baux as if astonished at its extraordinary aspect, and the
woman stood looking up at it curiously. Sometimes they
left the road to explore some of the clefts and rock
passages, and among the bare walls of limestone and the
narrow galleries, their songs&mdash;with which they had doubtless
delighted Marseilles audiences&mdash;reverberated most
fantastically. Evidently they were strolling minstrels
tramping the country, and were now probably on their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
way to St. Remy, Tarascon, and Beaucaire, and on to
Avignon and the cities of Languedoc; modern troubadours
following the ancient calling in the ancient country.
</p>

<p>
But ah, if Raimbaut de Vacqueiras had seen his
successors!
</p>

<p>
It was a touching little scene: the two footsore troubadours&mdash;jongleurs,
perhaps, one ought to call them&mdash;passing
wondering but unconscious below the city where
once their forefathers of the craft were welcomed and
honoured guests.
</p>

<p class="p2">
If the passes of the Alpilles were as desolate as a moon
landscape in the full blaze of a Provençal midday, what
were they in the grey of evening? The human spirit is
not fashioned to endure the aspect of these abysmal
regions of nature.
</p>

<p>
Masses of rock rising out of unknown deeps of shadow
take on the aspect of some lawless architecture, the
handiwork of an alien race: fantastic earth-born peoples
raising mad palaces half sublime, half grotesque:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
"great plinths, majestic porticoes."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
colonnades whose capitals are sculptured by the wind
spirits: strange half-finished cathedrals with pinnacles and
fretwork, flocks of gargoyles wrought by goblin sculptors.
</p>

<p>
There was one sublime insane cathedral looming
crazily through the dusk, with an encumberment of
caricatures of saints and angels, grinning faces, half
defined, half suggested&mdash;it seemed like some great Temple
of Evil.
</p>

<p>
From the Gorge of Hell, high up among the recesses
of the hills, opens the Witch's Grotto amidst "tortured
shapes which rise up, sink down, stretch into great entablatures
and gardens in the air."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This is the dreaded domain of Tavèn, the famous
sorceress of the Alpilles. She plays an important part in
Mistral's epic poem <i>Mireille</i> (or <i>Mirèio</i>, in the original
Provençal).
</p>

<p>
To this maiden and her lover Vincent, who visited her
cavern which stretches for long distances underground,
Tavèn gives extraordinary experiences. They have come
to her for aid in their love affair which Mireille's father,
a wealthy farmer on the outskirts of the Crau, violently
opposes. Vincent has been treacherously wounded by
his rival, an owner of cattle on the Camargue; a brutal
but wealthy suitor favoured by the father.
</p>

<p>
The sorceress is found at the bottom of the grotto amid
a "cloud of dreams," with a sprig of broom-grass in her
hand, which is called the devil's wheat. Above her head is
a raven perched on a beam, and beside him a milk-white
hen; also (for magical reasons) a sieve tied to the wall.
</p>

<p>
She leaps down a deep crevice, and her clients follow
her. She directs them to gird round their brows the
leaves of the mandrake, the gruesome plant of human
contours that shrieks aloud when its roots are torn out of
the ground.
</p>

<p>
Tavèn tells them that it is the blest plant of her master-in-magic
Nostradamus. The astrologer and magician
lived at St. Remy, and so was within easy reach of his
famous pupil.
</p>

<p>
Then the witch urges further descent into the depths,
crying,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Children, all regions exquisite and bright</p>
<p>Are but through woeful purgatory neared"&mdash;</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
a saying suggesting an idea of philosophic significance.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the whole fantastic story seems to have more
meaning in it than is ostensibly claimed, and contains
many hints of the deeper reaches of experience.

<p>
As Tavèn and her charges penetrate further into these
wilds, a blast of wind and a "pack of elves shriek through
the crypt," which is full of wailing.
</p>

<p>
Tavèn warns her scared visitors to keep on their
"charmed crowns," and to be undismayed by the huge
apparition that they see in the dusk: la Lavandière,
"whose throne is on Ventoux," where she makes rain
and lightning.
</p>

<p>
The whole dark factory of Evil is shown to the adventurers.
They are told how, on the last three days of
February and the first three of March, the tombs all open
and the tapers kindle, and

</div>
</div></div>

<p>
A phantom priest performs mass and the church bells
ring themselves of their own accord.
</p>

<p>
But one can hear the bells of Les Baux ringing thus
on wild March days and nights!
</p>

<p>
In the Grotto, Tavèn looses the "swarms of ill," and
they rush forth and hold a sort of Carnival, with wizards
from Varigoule, in the Luberon range, and ghouls from
Fanfarigoule on the Crau.
</p>

<p>
And in the midst of this appalling Desert of Stones,
where the wild thyme makes here and there a fragrant
carpet, this mad company dances the farandole.
</p>

<p>
It was with a pleasant human sense of comfort and
cheer that we found ourselves once more driving through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
the streets of St. Remy. Quieter now than ever these
little streets in the dusk, so that we could almost hear the
falling of the great yellow leaves of the plane-trees, softly,
occasionally, in the avenues. Quite from the other end
of the tiny town we could catch the rumble of the homing
omnibus, bringing its last freight of passengers from the
station, or more likely returning empty, to earn its rest
in the outhouse behind the hotel&mdash;happy, simple omnibus,
without a care in the world!
</p>

<p>
We were thankful to wash off the dust of the day, and
with it half our fatigue, and to hasten down to the <i>salle à
manger</i>, pleasantly tired with the long hours in the open
air, the long stream of strong impressions. And how
hungry we were! Impressions seem to need a large
amount of sustenance.
</p>

<p>
I think the waiter must be accustomed to famished
visitors returning from Les Baux, for he simply flew as
we appeared, dashed the menu down on the table, murmuring,
"Tout de suite, Mesdames," and was scurrying
back the next minute with two small tureens of smoking
soup. Never did soup taste so good or so comforting!
</p>

<p>
Life indeed has its contrasts! We thought of Les
Baux among the abysses of the Alpilles under the shroud
of night, with a light or two from the Chevelure d'Or and
the few neighbouring houses twinkling mysteriously on
the height, and perhaps that strange music stealing
into the darkness of the valley&mdash;while out on the Crau&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Si Mesdames désirent du vin blanc ou du vin
rouge?"
</p>

<p>
Thus sharply roused, we make a random choice,
(Barbara accused me of having replied "du Crau, s'il
vous plait,") and the waiter placed on the table a bottle
of good Provençal wine which tasted like distilled sunshine,
which indeed it was, just tempered with a breeze
from Mont Ventoux.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' name='Page_344' href='#Page_344'>344</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After the meal we were conducted once more to the
parlour, where the same little party was collected, all
interested to hear what we thought of Les Baux.
</p>

<p>
We expressed ourselves with warmth.
</p>

<p>
"Oui c'est belle," observed Madame, giving a hitch to
her work to bring it more under her fingers, "Voilà une
petite excursion ex-cess-ive-ment in-ter-ess-ante."
</p>

<p>
A desire to laugh became insistent, not at Madame,
but at the whole situation. But that was out of the
question. Had I been allowed to cry it would have
done almost as well, but that would have created still
more consternation, so I played up to Madame and
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"En effet, c'est une excursion la plus charmante que
nous avons fait en Provence," and happily no one seemed
to see how ridiculous the observation was.
</p>

<p>
We returned to the subject of St. Remy, of which
Madame knew a good deal&mdash;learnt, as she told us, from
some esteemed and instructive American clients.
</p>

<p>
Of Nostradamus and the troubadours and the Counts of
Provence her information was not exhaustive; though
she had some anecdotes and a personal feeling about the
Good King René who has made himself loved and
remembered by his countrymen for four centuries by his
goodness and the quality that we well call charm&mdash;recognising
in it an element of natural sorcery.
</p>

<p>
St. Remy must have been a bright little city in the
days of the Counts; the scene of many gay and knightly
doings.
</p>

<p>
And there were doings neither gay nor knightly in one
grim old house covered with demoniac gargoyles where
Nostradamus worked through the clear Provençal nights.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless it was in this narrow ancient street in that
gloomy, haunted house that Tavèn the witch came to
learn the mysteries of the art of magic. Perhaps it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' name='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
here that the philosopher on his side learnt many things
from his pupil, as wise teachers are apt to do.
</p>

<p>
One can but wonder how far the legend was founded
on fact and what actual part the Enchantress of the
Alpilles played in the life of
the great astrologer.
</p>

<p>
Barbara, who had a good
healthy appetite for romance,
hoped it was a love affair&mdash;which
was startling indeed!
</p>

<p>
Nostradamus in love seemed
a most profane idea, and it
took one some time to recover
from the suggestion. And it
was almost as much a comedown
for Tavèn. It removed
so much of her ghoulishness.
</p>

<p>
We consulted our hostess.
Madame knitted her brows.
She had heard about "ce
Monsieur là," from the instructive
Americans who came
to St. Remy for a visit of
three days and stayed three
years&mdash;an extravagant American
sort of thing to do!
</p>

<p>
"Mais jamais avait on
remarqué que Monsieur Nostradamus
était amoureux de
la sorcière des Alpilles; jamais,
jamais!"
</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i-349" id="i-349"></a>

<p class="caption">OLD HOUSE, ST. REMY.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By E. M. Synge.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
It sounded much more feasible in French and I began
almost to tolerate the preposterous theory.
</p>

<p>
"Néanmoins cela se peut," added Madame, who knew
something of life and that even magicians were human.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We were shown various relics and gifts of the American
clients and listened to many anecdotes, all testifying to a
most happy and unusual relationship, savouring of olden
days, between the hosts and guests of an inn. But as a
matter of fact, the American, the most modern of all
men, is curiously apt to bring about something of old-time
relationships, something of the cordiality and freedom,
the simple humanness that very old civilisations may
tend to weaken.
</p>

<p>
From talking of her clients, our hostess came to talking
of their friends among the Félibres and of Mistral's
<i>Mireille</i>, the modern epic of Provence. It breathes the
very spirit of the country.
</p>

<p>
It is the Homeric character of the life that has inspired
the poet; he saw in it a grandeur that we have been
taught to imagine belongs only to the times of the ancients;
probably because those times have been shown to us
through the eyes of genius. But the Provence of to-day
has also its seer who reveals its qualities of grandeur: the
poet of Maillane.
</p>

<p>
After our visit to Les Baux we lost no time in reading
the translation of the cantos in <i>Mireille</i> telling of the descent
into the Witch's Grotto. Vincent and Mireille are
there introduced to the Thirteenth Cavern, where they
find domesticated on the hearth seven black cats and two
dragons quietly emitting jets of blue flame without the
slightest signs of arrogance, but simply as part of the day's
work. Tavèn makes a brew in her cauldron and heals
the wound which Vincent's rival had inflicted. Then they
return to their homes, solaced for the time. But tragedy
awaits them. The father's opposition is brought to a
head when Vincent formally proposes for Mireille, and
her parents are so angry and so resolved to marry her to
the wealthy cattle-owner of the Camargue, that one dark
night she runs away from her home, directing her steps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' name='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
to the church of the Saintes Maries, to seek aid by her
prayers. We find her in the last canto a desolate, fragile
figure crossing the Crau. She arrives at last in the
island of the Camargue, and reaches, dying, the white
church where the three holy women float down through
the roof in answer to her prayers.
</p>

<p>
"We are Baux' guardian saints," they cry, bidding her
take comfort.
</p>

<p>
And they go on to tell her that she would not fear
death if she knew how small her little world appears
from their high dwellings: "how ripening hopes are
washed away with tears," while hatred and cruelty breed
sorrow where love should shed peace over all the
world.
</p>

<p>
However, before they understood all these things, they
had, like Mireille, to drain bitter cups to the dregs.
They tell her of their hopeless wanderings; how they
were delivered over to the mercy of the waves and landed
in Provence where their task was to convert the people
to Christianity; how St. Martha was impelled to go to
Tarascon to lure the Tarasque from its wicked ways;
and how she afterwards went to Avignon, "striking the
rock with her virginal discourse," and willing the waves
of faith to pour from it, whence long afterwards "Good
Gregory drank, and Holy Clement filled his cup with
life."
</p>

<p>
Just at the last, when Mireille is dying under the care
of the Saints, her distracted father and Vincent, broken-hearted,
arrive, but only just in time to see her pass
peacefully away into the silence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' name='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
</p>

<p>
From the windows of our rooms one can see above the
trees the fantastic summits of the Alpilles. They are
clear against a "jewel-enamelled sky."
</p>

<p>
The roses are exhaling their fragrance in the dark
garden just below; now and then the omnibus horses
peacefully move in their stalls, perhaps going over again
in their dreams the happy homeward journey after the
last train.
</p>

<p>
It is not yet late, but St. Remy has gone to its rest;
only the stars are awake and watching.
</p>

<p>
The sweet night air comes in quietly at the window
which has been unbolted and thrown open&mdash;not without
giant efforts, for French precautions against the dangerous
element are thorough and hard to circumvent.
</p>

<p>
The whole scene&mdash;black trees, mountains, stars&mdash;shows
through a mist of oncoming sleep and has the appearance
of some unearthly vision. The whole riddle of the universe
seems to be out there in the darkness; the answer
is there too, just behind the veil; only just behind&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;&mdash;eleven o'clock! The big
church in the Market Place strikes the hour with that
particularly solemn note of a clock striking in a sleeping
town.
</p>

<p>
"Hour for rest, hour for rest," it seems to admonish
the wakeful few.
</p>

<p>
Over all things Night and Peace spread wide their
wings&mdash;&mdash;

CHAPTER XXVII
</p>

<p class="center">ACROSS THE AGES
</p>

<p>
There is a vast work on Provence by le Sieur Honoré de
Bouche, Docteur en Theologie, A.P.D.S.I., printed at
Aix, by Charles David, "printer to the King, the clergy
and the town," MDCLXIV. It is bound in ancient
brown leather;&mdash;two majestic volumes which have to be
propped up against something substantial or laid upon a
family dining-table in order to be read in any sort of
security. Less serious treatment, such as an attempt to
balance the tomes on the knee between the arms of a
chair, however solid, always results in a temporary eclipse
of the student. The difficulties of acquiring erudition in
this case are physical as well as intellectual. But the
dangers of the road are worth braving even if one does
come off with an aching head and some few marks of
conflict.
</p>

<p>
The author, as beseems a doctor in theology, begins the
history of his country from the creation of the world, and
goes steadily on with a really terrible staying power till
the reign of Louis XIV., where he is forced to stop,
having arrived at his own times. The height of the
volumes is such that the reader has the sensation (and
almost the necessity) of alternately stretching and
collapsing like a telescope in order to read a page from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_352' name='Page_352' href='#Page_352'>352</a></span>
top to bottom; and this movement seems to emphasise
the sense given by the narrative of journeying through
the centuries in company with the whole brilliant procession
of Counts and Kings, rulers and high sovereigns
of Provence.
</p>

<p>
Roman governors, Pagan Emperors, Christian Emperors,
Burgundian and Visigoth Kings, Ostogoths and
Franks, Merovingians, Carlovingians, Kings of Arles and
Burgundy, Kings of Arles "high sovereigns"; Emperors
of the Holy Roman Empire; Counts Proprietary and
Hereditary of Arles and Provence, Counts of Anjou of
the 1st Race of the House of France, Counts of Anjou of
the 2nd Race, in the direct line of St. Louis; and finally,
from Louis XI. onwards&mdash;Kings of France: the long
pageant streams by in ordered magnificence, picturesque
in setting, rich in colour and attire, with splendid names
and sad, splendid destinies.
</p>

<p>
The Sieur de Bouche heads his first book in the
following full-blooded manner:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Provence.</span></p>

<p>
"Sous ses premiers et plus anciens maitres depuis la création du
monde jusqu'a á ce qu'elle ait este soumise à la domination des
Romains durant l'espace de 3,927 ans."
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is a mere preliminary, a slight introduction to the
body of the work.
</p>

<p>
The next Book treats of the country under the Romans
during 591 years, from 125 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to 466 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> This period
is divided into three sections.
</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>I. Provence under the Republic.</li>
<li>II. Provence under the Pagan Emperors.</li>
<li>III. Provence under the Christian Emperors</li>
</ul>

<p>
until the arrival of the Burgundians and Visigoths.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>353</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then comes Provence under the first barbarian kings,
Burgundian and Visigoth.
</p>

<p>
The period of the Frankish kings is again divided
into Sections (and let no one who has not tackled le
Sieur Honoré think lightly of a Section!)
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-357" id="i-357"></a>
<img src="images/i-357.jpg" width="253" height="313" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CHURCH DOOR, SAINTES MARIES.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By Joseph Pennell.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The first Section gives 127 years of Carlovingians till
879, when we enter upon the important era of the Kings
of Arles and Burgundy, and the beginning of Provence
as an independent territory.
</p>

<p>
Here again we have three Sections:&mdash;
</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Kings of Arles of the 1st Race,</li>
<li>Kings of Arles of the 2nd Race,</li>
<li>Kings of Arles of the 3rd Race,</li>
</ul>

<p>
the latter also being Kings of Burgundy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' name='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>354</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Book III. treats of the "Kings of Arles (without
property in Provence or Burgundy)."
</p>

<p>
Section I.&mdash;Kings of Arles, high sovereigns, relatives,
and heirs testamentary of Rudolph the last King of Arles
and Burgundy.
</p>

<p>
Section II.&mdash;Kings of Arles calling themselves high
Sovereigns "en qualité d'Empereurs estimant que ce
royaume a esté uny a l'Empire."
</p>

<p>
There were 254 years of this dispensation, and among
these rulers occur the names of the Emperor Lothair II.,
Frederick Barbarossa, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Then comes the division into "Fiefs of the Kingdom
of Arles."
</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>1st Fief. The County of Arles from the Durance to
the sea.
</li>

<li>
2nd Fief. The County of Forcalquier.
</li>

<li>
3rd Fief. The County of Venaison or of Avignon.
</li>

<li>
4th Fief. The County of Marseilles.
</li>

<li>
5th Fief. The Principality of Orange.
</li>

<li>
6th Fief. "Le Dauphiné."
</li>

<li>
7th Fief. The Duchy of Savoie.
</li>

<li>
8th Fief. The Sovereign Principality of Meurgues
(Monaco), the County of Grignan, the Barony of
Les Baux, of Castellane, &amp;c.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All this wide territory constituted the ancient Kingdom
of Arles.
</p>

<p>
Book IV. treats of the Counts Proprietary and Hereditary
from 910 until Provence is reunited to the Crown
of France (1481). To these the Sieur de Bouche devotes
many of his formidable Sections. There are long lines
of Bozons and Rothbolds of the 1st Race, and of
Raimonds and Raimond Berengers Counts of Catalonia
and of Barcellona and Kings of Aragon&mdash;beings of a most
strange personal appearance if one may judge by the
quaint old engravings which head each of the Sieur's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' name='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
Books of Chapters. They stare out of their medallions
with a grotesque expression of royal blankness combined
with a dull, obscure form of indignation which speaks
ill for the "agréments" of the post of ruler of Provence
in the later Middle Ages. The complication of names
and races and titles is almost hopeless at this period.
Even our dauntless author says wearily, "nous sortons
d'un lieu fort nuageux pour entrer dans un plus tenebreux."
</p>

<p>
There are three different genealogies of the Counts of
the 1st Race, and very little seems to be known of the
Counts themselves with the exception of William I.
</p>

<p>
"It was by him and his valliance that this faithless
and barbarous nation of Saracens was driven out who for
nearly 100 years occupied the famous fortress of Fraxinet
la Garde, whence they issued to make plundering expeditions
by sea and land; their fort of Fraxinet and all
Provence was entirely delivered from this impious and
cruel race of robbers...."
</p>

<p>
Travellers on the Riviera may see the little village of
Garde Freinet&mdash;as the ancient hornet's nest is now
called&mdash;peacefully dreaming among the mountains of the
Moors, that magnificent range whose name records for
ever the long domination of those irrepressible brigands.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants to this day are of obvious Saracen
type and the grey hill-top villages of this region are
living relics of that mysterious race.
</p>

<p>
As acknowledgment for his great services to his country
William I. was presented by the Seigneur Grimaldi of
Monaco with the lands contiguous to the fief of St. Tropez.
</p>

<p>
So uncertain seem to be the records of the dynasties of
Provence that the author has to prove the existence of
one of the Counts (Count Bertrand) by means of a
document in which he "restores, restitutes, and gives"
the Church of Notre Dame des Rats (qui est l'Eglise des
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' name='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
Trois Maries en la Camargue) "to the Church of Saint
Etienne and Saint Trophime of Arles."
</p>

<p>
The Catalan Counts of Provence: that is the 2nd
Race of Proprietary Counts who were also Counts of
Catalonia and Barcelona, give the same difficulty to their
historians, who do not agree among themselves. They
seem to have become confused by the multiplicity of
the names of Raimond Berenger and of Ildefons and
Alphonse&mdash;"qu'a moins d'avoir le filet d'Ariadne il est
impossible de sortir de ce Labyrinthe."
</p>

<p>
Among these confusing Counts, Raimond Berenger I.
stands out for his great virtues; and particularly, says the
theologian, "for his great piety towards the Catholic
religion and for the great pains he took for the destruction
and conversion of the Moors to the Christian faith":
"destruction and conversion" being apparently regarded
as part of the same pious process.
</p>

<p>
He is followed by a procession of Raimond Berengers
and Berenger Raimonds under whose reign were waged
wars with the House of Les Baux alternating with conventions
and agreements: long documents in Latin
which the Counts of Provence and the Princes of Les
Baux would meet in pomp to sign at Arles or at
Tarascon.
</p>

<p>
About this date, late in the twelfth century, was held
the great Council at Albi which condemned the Albigenses,
so called from that incident.
</p>

<p>
The placing of the remains of St. Martha in a beautiful
church at Tarascon where these had been hidden from
the Saracens and the Goths and Vandals, is noted as an
important event during the period.
</p>

<p>
Wars against the Vaudois and Albigenses are spoken
of in the reign of Raimond Berenger V., and it is curious
to see the account of these hideous persecutions given
by a doctor of the Church. The Pope, one would suppose,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' name='Page_357' href='#Page_357'>357</a></span>
had been an angel of patience, wearied out at last
by the aggressions and crimes of a set of unmanageable
criminals.
</p>

<p>
"Voyant que le douceur exasperait le mal il se resolut
de venir aux remèdes violants et extremes;" a resolution
which his Holiness thoroughly carried out.
</p>

<p>
In all these vast volumes there is not one word of
the unspeakable deeds of the Church during those
awful wars.
</p>

<p>
The Counts of Provence were ardently orthodox and
fought against Raimond, Count of Toulouse, the sole
friend of the Albigenses (as we have already seen).
</p>

<p>
The troubles of this noble and tolerant race came to
an end on the accession of St. Louis by the absorption of
the County of Toulouse in the Crown of France, the
brother of the king marrying the daughter of the Count,
and as they had no children, the lands of the heiress of
Toulouse (by compact) were ceded to the throne. Soon
after this, Provence also came under the government of
the House of France, for the brother of St. Louis,
Charles, Count of Anjou, married Beatrice of Provence,
and their union inaugurated the reign of the first race of
Angevins in Provence.
</p>

<p>
The ambition of these two brought about the fierce
dramatic struggle of Conrad and Manfred and Conradin
and the Sicilian Vespers, which ended by making Charles
of Anjou and Provence also King of Naples and Sicily.
</p>

<p>
It interests lovers of Provence to know that only one
Frenchman escaped the massacre of the Sicilian Vespers,
a Provençal of the great name of Porcelet (whose sombre
old house still stands intact at Les Baux) and he was
spared because of the great benevolence and nobility of
his character.
</p>

<p>
One of the great events in the history of the country
is the transference of the Papal Court to Avignon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_358' name='Page_358' href='#Page_358'>358</a></span>
Philip le Bel successfully intrigued to place on the Papal
throne as Clement V. a Frenchman living in France:
Le Gotto, Archbishop of Bordeaux. Having quarrelled
with Boniface VIII., Philip desired to have the management
of the Papacy in his own hands. Avignon goes
back to the Stone Age, so its claims to antiquity were as
great as those of Rome herself.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"In the air was ever a clashing of bells, mingling with the sound
of fife and drum; the people danced for joy, danced day and night on
the famous bridge, while the fresh air blew about them and the rapid
river flowed beneath. Such was Avignon, says tradition in the days
of the Popes."
</p>
</div>

<p>
But to return to the Angevin rulers of Provence. The
most famous of these were "la Reine Jeanne" (Queen of
Naples and Sicily and Countess of Provence) and the
good King René: both of them beloved and admired by
the Provençals to this day: Queen Jeanne because of
her wonderful beauty and grace, and King René for his
goodness, his charm, his <i>bonhomie</i>, his genius.
</p>

<p>
There are accounts of the coming of the brilliant
Queen to Avignon in order to obtain a dispensation from
the Pope to marry Louis of Taranto. "Ravishingly
beautiful, she arrived with great pomp, with a retinue
on the Rhone," met doubtless by the Cardinals in their
scarlet robes, and proceeding amongst the acclaiming
people to the palace.
</p>

<p>
Froissart, in an account of a later interview, makes
the Queen tell his Holiness that her father, son of
Robert the Good of the first Angevin Counts of Provence,
had advised her on his death-bed, if she had no heirs to
yield all her territory to whomsoever should be Pope.
"In truth, Holy Father, after his decease, with the
consent of the nobles of Sicily and Naples, I wedded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' name='Page_359' href='#Page_359'></a></span>

Andrew of Hungary&mdash;he died, a young man, at Aix-en-Provence...."
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
(As the Queen had had him murdered and thrown out
of a window at Aversa, her account of his death lacked
completeness.) She then casually mentions her next
husband, Prince of Taranto, and in the same sentence
alludes <i>en passant</i> to his successor, James, King of
Majorca.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Father," she adds demurely, "I then married
the Lord Otho of Brunswick."
</p>

<p>
The Sieur de Bouche, always methodical, arranges
Queen Jeanne's husbands in a list according to priority
(not alphabetical).
</p>

<p>
It is as difficult to arrive at the real story of this
famous lady as at that of Mary Queen of Scots. Both
were renowned for beauty, but both must have possessed
a quality of charm less easy to define or they could not
have exerted so powerful a hold on the imagination
of their contemporaries. Both were accused, if not
convicted, of great crimes, and both came to a tragic
end; Queen Jeanne dying in prison in her own kingdom
of Naples.
</p>

<p>
King René, the kind, merry, artistic, unpractical
monarch, who is said to have been able to do all
things except govern a kingdom, is remembered with
real love by his people. There is a romance attached
to his name. His first marriage was merely one of
State policy and during his wife's lifetime he is said
to have loved Jeanne de la Val, to whom he gave the
"celebrated and illustrious barony of Baux," in 1458.
</p>

<p>
On the death of the Queen Isabel, he married the lady
of his heart, and there appears good reason to believe
that this love-match was a deeply happy one, King and
Queen though the lovers were.
</p>

<p>
René the Good seems to have been made of that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' name='Page_361' href='#Page_361'>361</a></span>
sort of fibre that radiates happiness as the sun radiates
warmth.
</p>

<p>
During this reign the town of Orange gave birth to an
institution which seems curiously out of keeping with
the spirit of the time and place, viz., the Provençal
Parliament, the creation of Count William of Orange.
</p>

<p>
It was regarded popularly as one of the scourges of the
country,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"<i>Parlemant, Mistral et Durance</i></p>
<p><i>Sont les trois fléaux de Provence</i>";</p>
</div></div>

<p>
and later we hear complaints against the Parliament to
the Council of the Lateran for attacks made by it on
the "liberty of the Church," interference in the functions
of the bishops, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
But this is after the death of René, and after Charles
III., his nephew and successor, had left all his territory
to his cousin, Louis XI., and Provence once more lapsed
to the Crown of France.
</p>

<p class="p2">
From this point French history and Provençal history
become one, and Provence has for her Counts Louis XI.,
Francis I., Henry II., Francis II. ("Roy de France et
d'Ecosse," as de Bouche entitles him). Then come the
religious wars in Dauphiny and Provence, the suspension
of the Parliament, the Great Plague in the time of Henry
III., and the "birth of the Ligue, which has caused
so many evils in France," according to our historian.
</p>

<p>
The Etats Généraux de Provence were held at Aix in
the reign of Henry IV.
</p>

<p>
From this time to that of Louis XIV. the country is
hopelessly given over to religious troubles. Religion, or
the passions that are let loose under that name, have
been the scourge of this distracted land made by nature
for happiness and peace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' name='Page_362' href='#Page_362'>362</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Such are the bare outlines of Provençal history during
the times that, in this country of ancient lineage,
present an aspect almost modern. Those authors who
have studied the drama of its farthest past treat
familiarly of ages in which the Glacial Epoch plays
a quite juvenile <i>rôle</i>.
</p>

<p>
One writer (Berenger Feraud) divides the Paleolithic
Age into several epochs, one of which (Epoque Solutréen)
he alludes to as a relatively short one of 11,000
years; generally they are about 100,000 years or so.
</p>

<p>
In Provence the human story can be traced to the
earliest of those geological epochs when man could only
express himself by "modulated cries." It took centuries
and centuries to acquire a rudiment of words.
</p>

<p>
From the second epoch, when the country had become
colder, dates our venerable Hearth and Home; the family
living in caves (such as are still to be seen at Les Baux,
for instance), and sleeping or crouching round the wood
fires on long winter nights and days, slowly developing
speech from the increased need of exchanging sequent
ideas.
</p>

<p>
Then came the awful darkness and death of the Glacial
Period, changing still further the contours of the country.
</p>

<p>
The retreat of the glacial cold ushered in the "Epoque
Magdalenienne," when life became comparatively easy,
though the climate of Provence was still "colder than
that of St. Petersburg." The Magdaleniens had arrived
at sculpturing rough figures on the rocks, and from those
records it is concluded that they were gay, jovial, and
inclined to pleasantry; the sort of person apparently who
makes a dinner-party go well. Strange dinner-parties
they must have had in their wild nooks and caverns
in the mountains of Provence!
</p>

<p>
Gradually from these mysterious days we emerge upon
centuries less absolutely hidden from our curiosity: the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_363' name='Page_363' href='#Page_363'>363</a></span>
time of the invasion of the Ligurians, Iberians, Celts,
and other races, from about the fifteenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to
600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> This brings us almost back to the light of day,
with the rather startling consciousness that the ancient
Ligurians, who represented to the imagination the beginning
of all things Provençal, suddenly appear as modern
innovations.
</p>

<p>
A long stretch of time had still to pass, filled with
a hundred half-fabulous events, before the Roman Conquest
brought the country within the domain of actual
history.
</p>

<p class="p2">
And during all those ages what language was being used
and developed by the multitudes of races that passed like
phantoms across the country, phantoms to our imagination,
yet each race, each individual, driven to wild and
eager deeds and desires by the strange life-force, the
"will to live," that sets the whole extraordinary pageant
of things in motion?
</p>

<p>
From the "modulated cries" of the men who lived in
holes in the earth&mdash;not yet in the comparatively elegant
cave-dwellings&mdash;to the exquisite language of the troubadours,
what has been the course of its growth? No one
knows. The only real guide that remains is the language
itself, a confusing phonographic record of the whole
troublous existence of the country of its birth.
</p>

<p>
The nearer a language is to its origin the more it
is complicated. Ingenious and subtle grammatical forms
prove an ancient tongue.<a name='FA_25' id='FA_25' href='#FN_25' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a>
</p>

<p>
The natural progress is from synthesis to decomposition;
and this decomposing force is nothing more nor
less than the natural laziness of the human being, one of
the most tremendous forces of the universe!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' name='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>364</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"All dialects originate from this germ of decomposition,
in opposition to the antique synthetic principle of
the language," says M. Fauriel.
</p>

<p>
Thence progress can be studied by following backwards
a language to its source, that is to its more complex form.
But for long stretches of time no specimens of written
language existed. Most of the popular songs and stories
were transmitted orally, and so there is only a document
here and there to reveal the slow development.
</p>

<p>
The influence of Rome as a civiliser was so enormous
that it acted as a break on the new movement which was
destined in time to create the world we call modern.
That new world which the Barbarians were to bring
into being was postponed in the making by the very
excellence of the institutions that it gradually superseded.
</p>

<p>
This slowness of pace affected the language. It took
six centuries to transmute the Latin into the Romance
tongues, a process as tremendous in its way as the
formation during geological eons of the limestone
and the chalk.
</p>

<p>
Two great movements had taken place in the speech of
Gaul and Spain; first the imposition of the Latin tongue
on the conquered provinces and then the reversal of the
process till the Latin was again corrupted back into
dialects. In the return journey the Latin remained
as a foundation and in it were left many words belonging
to the ancient language of the country, so that non-Latin
words in Romance may date from either before
or after the introduction of the classic tongue.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the fourth century that it showed
signs of giving way. It broke up gradually into modern
French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Roumanian Provençal.
The tribes of the Acquitani gave the character
to the dialects of the South-west, where, according to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' name='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>365</a></span>
many writers, their speech still survives in the Basque
language.
</p>

<p>
It would be a long story, that of the great Romance
tongues from the earlier waverings of the Latin in the
fourth century, to the eleventh century, when the first
troubadour, Guillem de Poictiers, delighted the knights
and ladies of Limousin and half France with his songs.
</p>

<p>
The <i>langue d'oc</i> was by that time ready to his hand, or
so it would seem, for it is a remarkable fact that there
is scarcely any difference between the language of this
pioneer troubadour and that of his latest successors in
the thirteenth century, whose voices were so soon to be
drowned in the din and horror of the Albigensian wars.
</p>

<p>
Two hundred years of dance and song! Something
at least saved from the gloom and folly of the human
story!
</p>

<p>
During the six hundred years from the fourth to the
eleventh century modern Europe, its religion, its institutions,
its language, its destiny were in process of
formation. And a rude process it was.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
During these centuries, "deluged with blood," the
language must have been in a state of fusion. We
know that, for the earlier epochs at least, no one could
write his name except a cleric, and agreements were all
signed with a cross. There was no general social movement,
only incessant changes in the balance of power
between kings and nobles. Brutal, unreasoning, material
in the real sense of the word, despite their reputation
as ages of faith, these centuries were destitute of progressive
elements, and there was little or nothing to
cause the speech to refine or develop. Literature and
Latin died together. The Gallic tongue left traces in
the speech of the South and there are several Provençal
words in Irish and Welsh and in the language of the districts
of the Vaudois showing their common Celtic origin,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366' href='#Page_366'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_367' name='Page_367' href='#Page_367'>367</a></span>
if one may judge from the first words of the Lord's
Prayer:&mdash;

<p>
Strange to say, the Franks left scarcely any trace in the
speech of the country. Wide as were the conquests of
this people, with Charlemagne for Emperor in later
days, their victory did not extend to the language.
</p>

<p>
Latin, as we have seen, flagged in the fourth century,
and was finally extinguished about the middle of the
ninth century.
</p>

<p>
This breaking up of the speech of the Romans into
Romance forms a curious analogue to the breaking up
of the Roman architecture into Romanesque. This
latter change took place after the formation of independent
States had superseded the old centralising
Imperial idea.
</p>

<p>
Architecture, in its turn, developed different local
styles, all deriving their character from the Roman and
all called by the general name of Romanesque.
</p>

<p>
The chief peculiarity of Provençal Romanesque is in
the pointed vaultings of the churches as distinguished
from the familiar round arch of the Roman work.
</p>

<p>
The date of the introduction of the pointed arch into
Gaul is a vexed question, but it is certain that it arrived
earlier in Provence than in the North of France. It was
found easier to build, and it "exerted less thrust on the
side walls."<a name='FA_26' id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a>
</p>

<p>
But it was used in Provence for utilitarian reasons only,
and it curiously happened that the South abandoned the
pointed arch just when the North began to adopt it for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' name='Page_368' href='#Page_368'>368</a></span>
decoration. The South preferred the round arch for this
purpose, and as the architects grew more skilful they
were able to cope with its difficulties, and thus&mdash;contrary
to the usual rule&mdash;the pointed form in Provence denotes
greater antiquity than the round vaulting. In the North,
of course, it is exactly the reverse.
</p>

<p>
Byzantine influence was introduced into the South by
the trade channel through France with the Levant, of
which Perigueux in Acquitaine was a centre, and here the
Venetian traders built a church on the plan of St. Mark's
at Venice. This church of Perigueux was taken as a
model by local architects who introduced the Byzantine
dome and the aisleless nave; this latter being also a
Byzantine feature, which may be seen in some of the
churches of Toulouse for instance. Byzantine, or possibly
merely late Roman influence is shown in the polygonal
form of the apses and cupolas, "in the flat arches employed
to decorate the walls, in the mouldings with small
projections and numerous members; in the flat and
delicate ornament; and in the sharp and toothed carving
of the foliage."
</p>

<p>
Another feature of Provençal work is the strikingly
Roman character, produced, it is supposed, by the great
number of fine Roman buildings in the country. These
architectural models, according to the authoritative opinion
of Ross and McGibbon, while stimulating the growth of
the art of the South, probably prevented it from developing
on original lines by "impressing on it the stamp
of the classic trabeated style," that is the construction
founded on that of the archaic buildings formed of
wooden beams.
</p>

<p>
This process of architectural development, while analogous
to that of the language, is naturally much simpler
and much easier to follow. The history of the speech of
this great continent is wearisomely obscure and complex.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' name='Page_369' href='#Page_369'>369</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Gaston Paris<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> writes as follows:&mdash;"There were in
Gaul at the Merovingian epoch, without mentioning the
Basque and Breton corners, three languages: (1) grammatical
Latin, become a dead language; (2) the vulgar
Latin or Romance spoken by all the indigenous population;
(3) the German represented by the Frank, the
Burgundian, and the Gothic."
</p>

<p>
But the Germans in Gaul, mixing with the ancient
Gallo-Roman families, ended by speaking Romance, all
distinctions between the two races disappearing. The
writings of Gregory of Tours throw light upon this
transitional period, the <i>lingua rustica</i> having by that time
encroached upon the would-be grammatical Latin.
</p>

<p>
"... There were profound alterations suffered by the
speech of the people in the vowels and consonants during
the Merovingian epoch," and during that same epoch new
principles of rhythm which permitted of versification in
the Romance tongue were being slowly and laboriously
adapted to these alterations of sound.<a name='FA_28' id='FA_28' href='#FN_28' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> From this the
author concludes that there existed a "poetic activity,"
though we have no detailed remains to prove it. We
know only that at the spring festivals (survivals of antiquity)
there were popular songs and dances. Those who
recited and sang were called <i>joculares</i>&mdash;and caused
much scandal to the Christian moralists!
</p>

<p>
The lighter German songs of love and wine have left no
obvious trace, but the elements of their epics are embedded
in the French <i>epopée</i> which Gaston Paris thinks
owes to them its existence. He speaks of it as the
outcome of the national spirit&mdash;which had arisen after
the Franks had given a sort of unity to the country&mdash;and
of the more individualist inspiration of the German epics.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' name='Page_370' href='#Page_370'>370</a></span>
Thus the popular language must have been under a
smelting or moulding process, passing through the poetic
crucible for many a year of which we have no record.
</p>

<p>
There are but few milestones on this ancient road, but
if all were carefully examined in order of time, it is
probable that the gaps might be bridged over by the eye
of learning and the line of development made plain.
</p>

<p>
An anecdote of the tenth century, given by M. Fauriel,
illustrates the condition of the language of that date.
</p>

<p>
A Gaul who had been present at several of the miracles
of St. Martin, being asked by some Acquitanians to give an
account of them, is diffident, and says he is illiterate.
</p>

<p>
"Speak as you please," said one of the Acquitanians,
"speak Celtic or Gothic if you prefer it, provided only
you speak of St. Martin."
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that the language of Acquitaine
which has lingered in the valleys of the Pyrenees began to
be called Basque. The rest of the country was speaking
the Romance, with its 3,000 "barbarian words." Among
these are some Acquitanian, a few of which are below:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Basque Words in Provençale.</span>

<p>
Unlike the languages of the so-called Sanscrit type (to
which belong Greek, Latin, Celtic, and even Slavonian),
the Basque&mdash;as is well-known&mdash;cannot be traced back to
any common origin: this mysterious aboriginal tongue of
the Acquitani is an orphan and an alien without kith or
kin, unless indeed the adventurous writer who claims for
it an Etruscan origin be in the right.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371' href='#Page_371'>371</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Acquitaine took a large part in the wars with the
invading Arabs of Spain, and their Duke Eudes, after
many victories, was finally defeated by the famous Abderrahman
and the county was left at the mercy of the
conquerors until Charles Martel at length expelled them.
</p>

<p>
It was in these wars that Charlemagne made his
famous and disastrous expedition to Ronçevalles which
inspired the poetic imagination of the day.
</p>

<p>
The many wars of these times of transition and the
long struggles of the Gallo-Romans and Acquitanians
against the Franks formed subjects for the popular poetry
which was slowly working towards the literary outburst
of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries.

kingdom, but on his death
they at once went to war
with the Franks and led the way to the dismemberment
of the Carlovingian Empire. There is an ancient poem
whose name and hero is Walter of Acquitaine&mdash;related
to the Nibelingen and Scandinavian sagas&mdash;which seems
to represent the national and anti-Frankish spirit of
the Acquitanians and of all the Gallo-Roman epoch.
</p>

<p>
It was in Limousin, as we have seen, that all these
movements of popular literature finally arrived at a sort
of culmination, and we find ourselves suddenly in a
brilliant world of gaiety and song.
</p>

<p>
Count Ebles III. of Ventadour was then composing
his verses of "alacrity and joy," and the Châteaux of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' name='Page_372' href='#Page_372'>372</a></span>
Limousin were enthusiastically cultivating the new
poetry; and a little later William IX. of Poictiers, the
"first troubadour," was born, the gay, courteous teller of
stories and singer of songs, of whom the already quoted
saying was abroad that "he went about the world to
impose on the ladies."
</p>

<p>
He had the audacity to refuse to join the Crusade,
perhaps because he was a "free-thinker"&mdash;a rare being
indeed in those days&mdash;denying the existence of God.
</p>

<p>
But when Jerusalem fell and the Christians were
forming a kingdom there, he went out with a multitude of
knights to join them, though apparently with a heavy heart.
</p>

<p>
On the eve of departure he composed a lyric to his
native land.

And so, in this confused struggling fashion, during the
course of centuries, the <i>langue d'oc</i> came to be the
language of chivalry and romantic love: the language in
which are written the laws of courtesy and of honour that
we reverence to this day. The transition from the rudeness
which was fitted to express the few ideas of early
mediæval life to the fineness and polished charm of the
troubadour poetry remains always more or less of a
mystery; but however it came about, it is certain that
when the troubadours and the chivalrous knights were
born into the world by the "grace of God," the beautiful
characteristic tongue which had been forged for their use
by the beating of the ages of events was waiting and
worthy to carry the thought and the emotion of an
awakening people.

CHAPTER XXV
</p>

<p class="center">THE SONG OF THE RHONE
</p>

<p>
With the spirit of the country, the whole crew and
company of the <i>Caburle</i>&mdash;Maître Apian's barge in Mistral's
poem&mdash;seems to be imbued. Even the little maiden
Anglore&mdash;in love with a water-sprite&mdash;even she has
caught something of the large <i>abandon</i> of the great
stream.
</p>

<p>
Warned that the Prince&mdash;whom she believes to be the
Drac&mdash;will fascinate and then desert her, she cries: "Eh!
bien qu'il me fascine. Si mon destin est tel, moi, je me
laisserai choir a la pipée, comme au gouffre béant tombe
la feuille."
</p>

<p>
The whole poem is steeped in the movement and sunshine
of the river: the charm of the life on its banks,
especially in times now past; the plying of the barges up
and down, laden with merchandise, the towns and ancient
castles that they pass, the gay spirit of the passengers
along this buoyant thoroughfare, "l'ornière du monde"
as Maître Apian calls it, the owner of the "most famous
equipage of the whole river"&mdash;seven barges and forty
horses for towing. In the finest of them, the <i>Caburle</i>, he
sets forth from the neighbourhood of Lyons to descend
the river to Beaucaire for the great fair, his other barges
following, with cargo and with food for the horses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' name='Page_376' href='#Page_376'>376</a></span>

</div>
</div></div>

<p>
And so the little flotilla goes on its way down the current,
the <i>Caburle</i> leading, with the image of St. Nicholas at its
prow, and at the poop, placed high on the rudder, the
mariner's cross, painted red and carved (one winter
when the waters had been caught in the grip of the
frost) by Maître Apian himself. And the instruments
of the Passion: nails, lance, hammer, and all associated
with it directly or indirectly, are piously represented.

<p>(With cargo for the fair of Beaucaire, there are a</p>

</div>
</div></div>

<p>
And there is a friendly rivalry between them, for the
first boat to arrive at the meadow of Beaucaire receives,
as a welcome from the citizens, a fine sheep. Alas! as
we know, the days of the fair of Beaucaire are over!
</p>

<p>
"Despachatiéu, en aio, fourro-bourro."
</p>

<p>
"In haste, agitated, pell-mell," the mariners bestir
themselves, and the merry, busy procession moves down
stream. Maître Apian lifts his cap.

<p>
"To the Rhone!" he cries, and all who are with him
uncover their heads, and make the sign of the cross,
dipping their fingers in the wave&mdash;for the river is blessed
every year, with a fine procession at the Pont St. Esprit,
and so it is holy water.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' name='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>377</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A most singular and very "mixed" company the
<i>Caburle</i> carries with her down the river during twelve
long cantos: among them, curiously enough, William of
Orange, son of the King of Holland, who had been sent
to Provence for his health. Besides him there are three
Venetian ladies who keep their companions lively with
songs and jests. And this little blond prince&mdash;whom the
doctors think the mistral is likely to benefit&mdash;has come
to seek the flower of the Rhone of which he has heard so
much&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Flour de pantai, de gentun, de belésso,</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>("Fleur de beauté, fleur de grace et de rêve</p>
<p>Par tout pays ou on la trouve,</p>
<p>L'homme est joyeux, la femme belle.")</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
Then they all tell him that it is the flowering rush
that nourishes itself in the water&mdash;which "l'Anglore"
loves to gather. And the little blond prince pricks
up his ears and wants to know who or what is l'Anglore.
And thereby hangs a tale.
</p>

<p>
"La voilà, la voilà," they all cry on the barges.
</p>

<p>
Her hand on her hip, Anglore, with a branch of the
flower of the Rhone in her hand, stands on the bank
waiting and smiling. Since her infancy she has come to
watch these boats arriving, the great flat boats that they
call <i>sisselands</i> on the river. Well known to all the
sailors, she would exchange greetings and friendly
badinage with them as they passed. And the men
would throw apples and pears into her apron as she
held it out to catch them. She was a familiar figure
along the water-side, and bore the nickname of Anglore,
the lizard, because she was always basking in the sun on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' name='Page_378' href='#Page_378'>378</a></span>
the banks. But she was not idle. Assiduously she sifted
with her little sieve the grains of gold that the Ardèche
brought down after the rains. Her father was a pilot at
the Pont St. Esprit to guide the boats past the "spurs of
the treacherous buttresses." And the sailors, having
passed the Trois Donzelles and the Îles Margeries,
would say joyously&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Allons, ... nous allons bientôt voir</p>
<p>Au Malatra papilloner l'Anglore."</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
And there, sure enough, she was, with her red handkerchief
on her head, busy at work. And they would
cry, "Ohé, has she not made her fortune, l'Anglore?"
</p>

<p>
And Anglore replies, "Aïe! pauvrette, ils n'en jettent
pas tant d'or dans l'Ardèche, ces gueux de Cévennols!
Mais vous passez bien vite."
</p>

<p>
"Le Rhône est fier (high) there is no stopping, belle
jeunesse! But when we go up stream on our return, and
the horses pull at the ropes, then we will bring you some
dates."
</p>

<p>
"Bon voyage aux marins," she cries farewell.
</p>

<p>
"Adieu, Mignonne!"
</p>

<p>
And one of the crew, Jean Roche, throws her several
kisses as the barge moves away. He has a tender interest
in the maiden, who however has no heart to give him,
for she has been fascinated by a most singular lover, the
Drac, or Spirit of the Rhone who lives under the green
waters and entices unwary maidens down and down to
his shimmering home beneath the flood.

<p>
It seems to intoxicate the children of the riverside.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div></div>

<p>
The mother of Anglore tells her children of the dangers
of the river; of "the blues" of the calm water where it
is of profound depth. It is here that the Drac loves to
disport himself: a fishlike creature, svelte as a lamprey,
twisting himself joyously in the whirl of the waters, with
greenish hair which floats on the waves like seaweed.
Anglore hears the story of the young woman of Beaucaire
beating her linen on the river banks, when she
suddenly sees the Drac in the water, and he makes a
sign of invitation to his palace of crystal where he promises
to show her all his riches, the wreckage of shipping
for many a year. And the maiden, unable to resist the
strange fascination, is drawn under the waves in a sort of
dream; and for seven long years she lives with the Drac
in his fresh green grotto filled with watery light.
</p>

<p>
And Anglore, on one hot, still night, goes down to the
banks in the moonlight. In the profound silence she hears
the murmur of the river. The glowworms are throwing
their strange glamour on the grass and the nightingales
are answering one another in the woods; and then
suddenly the girl seems to lose her head, and flinging
off her few garments, plunges into the stream.
</p>

<p>
It is a half fearful pleasure as she moves through its
cool freshness. If a fish ricochets over the surface in
pursuit of a fly, if a little whirlpool makes a tiny sound
of in-sucking as it twirls in the rush, if a bat cries,
her heart gives a sick beat. But it is joy to be thus
clothed by the sumptuous mantle of the torrent; "to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_381' name='Page_381' href='#Page_381'>381</a></span>
mingled, confounded with the great Rhone." Suddenly,
in the moonlight, deep down, stretched upon the moss&mdash;the
Drac! His eyes fix her, fascinate; and fearful,
stupefied, she has to go towards the sorcerer who
murmurs words of mysterious love. And then, all at
once, Anglore, feeling his cold arms round her, springs
up and sees gliding through the water a vague shadow,
serpentine and white, and floating on the surface a
flowering reed!
</p>

<p>
A narrow escape! But the quaint part of the story is yet
to come. When the barge of Maître Apian makes its
return journey the crew throws the rope ashore and
Anglore knots it round an old stake. Then Jean Roche
takes Anglore in his arms and lifts her on board, and
every one crowds round to welcome her.
</p>

<p>
"Eh bèn, que dis Angloro?" they cry.
</p>

<p>
"Dise tout bèn de vous," she replies politely.
</p>

<p>
Then Jean Roche says, "Santo que canto! If thou
wert not more sensible than I, Anglore, dost thou know
what we would do?"
</p>

<p>
"Pancaro, digo" (Pas encore, dis).
</p>

<p>
"Well, to-morrow evening we would go together to see
the plays at Beaucaire, the two of us, arm in arm, on the
meadow we would go and see the gypsies who tell fortunes;
we would stroll round to all the booths, and I
would buy you a beautiful ring."
</p>

<p>
"Of glass?" asks Anglore.
</p>

<p>
"No, of gold. And at the end of the fair I would
bring you back as my wife at Saint Maurice."
</p>

<p>
But Anglore laughs and puts him off, and finally tells
him that he has been forestalled by one who would drown
him in the depths of the Rhone if he caught him fishing
in his "lone."<a name='FA_30' id='FA_30' href='#FN_30' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a>
</p>

<p>
So poor Jean Roche relapses into dismal silence. Presently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' name='Page_382' href='#Page_382'>382</a></span>
the Prince of Orange, radiant, and carrying a
branch of the flower of the Rhone, issues from his tent
on the barge where he has been sleeping, humming, still
half asleep, the Venetian song of the three lively ladies&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sur mon bateau qui file</p>
<p>Viens, je t'enlève au frais:</p>
<p>Car, prince de Hollande,</p>
<p>Je n'ai peur de personne."</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
And Anglore suddenly turns very pale and nearly faints.
</p>

<p>
"C'est lui! c'est lui!" she cries wildly; and it turns
out that she takes the prince for the Drac! And he,
with his mind turning on the object of his search, says
that he recognises her. "O fleur du Rhone epanouie
sur l'eau."
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Drac, je te reconnais! car sous la lone</p>
<p>Je t'ai vu dans la main le bouquet que tu tiens.</p>
<p>A ta barbette d'or, à ta peau blanche,</p>
<p>A tes yeux glauques, ensorceleurs, perçants,</p>
<p>Je vois bien qui tu es."</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
Rather embarrassing for Monsieur le Prince! However
he is quite equal to the occasion. He presents her
with the flower, and then&mdash;suddenly he trembles! It is
scarcely necessary to add (we are in Provence) that the
next canto is occupied with the loves of Anglore and the
blond prince.
</p>

<p>
These go simply and smoothly on board the barge,
where the mariners show the most astonishing tact and
never seem to get in the way. When the Prince asks
Anglore what she would say if he told her he was really
the son of the King of Holland, she replies, "My Drac, I
should simply say that you can transfigure yourself into
any form that may be agreeable to you, and if you have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
taken that of the Prince of Orange it is for some freak or
mad fancy. Oh! my Drac, of what use is it to try to
hide yourself?"
</p>

<p>
What was there to be done (the poem demands) but
instantly to embrace "la folatre"? It is hard to say,
adds the poet, "which is the more intoxicated, more
under the spell of enchantment."
</p>

<p>
And so, in their great happiness they float down stream.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"radieux et ivres de votre luminière du Rhone."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Fields, vineyards, olive-groves, castles, cities, drift by as
in a beautiful dream.
</p>

<p>
All the while the hot Provençal sun is beating on the
barge, and the sorceress river is flowing and flowing: the
whole scene a symbol of the country and its magic. After
one has swept down and toiled up the Rhone in the
<i>Caburle</i>, one knows a little more of what it all means,
this fief of the sun and wind, this Land of the Passionate
River!

CHAPTER XXVI
</p>

<p class="center">THE CAMARGUE
</p>

<p>
Sometimes a lonely sea-mew breaks the monotony of the
sky, or, some huge-winged bird, the "stalking hermit of
the lagoon," casts a flitting shadow.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="i10">"One vast desert ...</p>

</div></div>

<p>
In summer there are no flowers in this forsaken region,
only the white inflorescence of salt crystals&mdash;frozen tears
of generations of vanished peoples one might fancy them.
And, as if in mockery, a mirage, born of those bitter
tears, hovers on the horizon as the hot sun breeds an
invisible vapour from which arise distant cities and a
labyrinth of smooth lagoons that shimmer alluringly
across the white solitude.
</p>

<p>
Such is the Camargue. The description, however,
applies in strictness to the summer season. In winter
the salt with which the ground is saturated is not visible;
there is only a moist oozy-looking soil, growing reeds and
stunted bushes.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Mistral's heroine, <i>Mirèio</i>, who dies in the Camargue at
the Church of Les Saintes Maries, falls down exhausted
before she arrives there, by the shores of the great lake of
the Camargue and is awakened by the stinging of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388' href='#Page_388'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' name='Page_389' href='#Page_389'>389</a></span>
dangerous gnats which infest the whole region in the hot
season, and perhaps account for the malaria which lies
in wait for the careless traveller.
</p>

<p>
The driver of the carriage in which we traversed this
river-encircled district, told us that in summer the water
in these branches of the Rhone fell so low that the fish
died in immense quantities, and this attracted great
swarms of flies whose sting became very perilous in consequence
of their gruesome banquet.
</p>

<p>
This deserted region is a near neighbour of the Crau,
separated only by the river at the southern end from the
Field of Pebbles; yet in all the Camargue, as the natives
say, you cannot find a stone to throw at a dog&mdash;a mode
of expression betraying the sentiment of the country as
regards our four-footed friends and brothers.
</p>

<p>
Our journey was from Aigues Mortes to Les Saintes
Maries, a drive across the Camargue of about 36 kilometres&mdash;36
kilometres of strange, silent, mournful
country, well-nigh desert, for the salt in the soil prevents
cultivation and all growth is stunted and wild and of
little use except here and there for grazing purposes.
From time immemorial it has been the home of herds of
black cattle, "wild cattle" they are generally called, and
in all the poems and accounts of the district, one finds
highly-coloured descriptions of the driving of these
ferocious creatures to pasture and of the exciting barbaric
ceremony of branding them in the spring. They are
always spoken of as being extremely formidable, and their
appearance in great hordes, fierce and untamed, their
dashing owners in pursuit on splendid steeds, is described
with charming picturesqueness.
</p>

<p>
Our driver kept a keen look-out for these creatures as
we made our way across the plain. At last, just as we
were in despair of seeing them, he pointed out their hoof-marks
where they come down to the water to drink. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' name='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>390</a></span>
was a thrilling moment, and we scanned the distance with
eagerness, listening for the thunder of galloping feet.
Suddenly the driver pulled up and gave an exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"Les Voilà!"
</p>

<p>
Alas! a disillusion, the first we had met with in
Provence.
</p>

<p>
A little way off, in quite domestic tranquillity, were
some twenty or thirty amiable, decorous-looking black
beasts who had presumably never "thundered" or
dreamt of it in all their well-spent lives. Day after day,
from byre to pasture and from pasture to byre, at no
time even in their giddiest calfdom had they given their
guardian&mdash;who was now superintending their repast&mdash;a
moment's uneasiness! Fiery, untamed cattle, at any
rate in the winter season, are not to be seen on the
Camargue.
</p>

<p>
The red flamingoes, too, are really pink, and very pale
at that; but it is beautiful to see them flying in great
flocks over the lake of the Vaccares, and settling to feed
or to exchange ideas on some wild islet on whose low
shores beat white-capped fussy little waves which the
smallest mistral quickly raises on its shallow water.
</p>

<p>
We visited this lake from Arles on another occasion,
for the Camargue is too big to see all at one time. Even
as it was, our day was crowded&mdash;to Aigues Mortes in the
morning across the plain, visiting Les Saintes Maries,
and back to Arles in the evening.

<p>
After Carcassonne one felt there was nothing more to
experience in the shape of a mediæval city. Yet Aigues
Mortes&mdash;the city of St. Louis, the City of the Marsh,
with its wonderful ramparts and square towers, all unchanged
since the days of the Crusaders&mdash;brought before
the eye of the imagination yet another aspect of the
fascination of the Middle Ages. The walls are said to be
built on the models of the fortified towns of Syria and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' name='Page_391' href='#Page_391'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' name='Page_392' href='#Page_392'>392</a></span>
to be almost a repetition of those of Ascalon. Here, as
in many mediæval cities, were originally wooden balconies
overhanging the base of the walls, the battlements being
in fact a wall with ingress at intervals to the balcony.
Later was substituted for the wooden balcony projecting
galleries of stone on corbels, and these stone galleries or
machicolations are comparatively recent.
</p>

<p>
To this scene belongs, among other historical events,
the splendid procession of St. Louis and his followers
as they embarked from this city of his founding for the
first crusade.
</p>

<p>
The place is called Aigues Mortes from the dead
branches of the river,<a name='FA_31' id='FA_31' href='#FN_31' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a> and its situation in this low-lying
ground near the sea, with the whole Camargue lying flat
and mournful before it, bears out the suggestion of the
strange melancholy name.
</p>

<p>
Ancient writers of romance are fond of talking about
the "frowning walls" of a city. On looking back at
Aigues Mortes as one recedes from it across the Camargue
one admits their justification. The dark high ramparts,
with their stern-looking square towers&mdash;unlike the round
extinguisher towers of Carcassonne&mdash;do most undeniably
"frown."<a name='FA_32' id='FA_32' href='#FN_32' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a>
</p>

<p>
The city with its great gateway seems not to belong to
our present life at all, in spite of its hotels and shops and
the people in the market-place. It is as if a fragment of
the tenth or eleventh century had been dropped by some
accident when the Scroll of Time was being rolled up!
</p>

<p>
The illusion is almost painfully perfect, producing that
curious bewilderment with which we provincial mortals
(by no means yet citizens of the universe) are assailed
when forced to realise&mdash;as well as intellectually to accept&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' name='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
fact of a state of existence absolutely alien to our
own experience.
</p>

<p>
Another delightful expedition in the Camargue is to
the Church of St. Gilles on the outskirts of this extraordinary
desert through which the main line runs at this
point; and many of the trains stop at the little station
only a short distance westward from Arles. By a singular
chance the curé happened to be in the train on his way to
Nimes, to read a paper about the many vexed archæological
questions regarding this famous and exquisite church, this
"ne plus ultra of Byzantine art," as Mèrimée calls it;
and he was much delighted to talk about the building of
which he is immensely proud.
</p>

<p>
Such a Church for beauty and interest had never before
existed! These were the sentiments of the good curé, a
rosy-cheeked, comfortable, courteous old antiquary. It
certainly merits his enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
The three great richly sculptured arches of the façade
are magnificent of their kind. It seems as if all the saints
and angels of Christendom had alighted in a swarm upon
these sumptuous portals. They cluster on frieze and
cornice, on arch and bracket and niche, in multitudes, the
whole work perfectly balanced and finely executed, and
resulting in an effect of romantic richness combined with
the pious simplicity of sentiment which is characteristic
of all Southern Romanesque churches. The crypt is
especially magnificent.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE CHURCH OF LES SAINTES MARIES SEEN FROM THE CAMARGUE.
<br /><span class="flright"><i>By Joseph Pennell.</i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
But the church of which one hears the most in
Provence is "Les Saintes Maries," or "Santa Maria
de la Mar," as it was sometimes called in the twelfth
century. It is another of the fortified churches of the
littoral, a sister to Maguelonne and still more famous.
At one end of our long day's journey stood Aigues Mortes,
at the other Les Saintes Maries. The little white speck
above the level of the plain on the far horizon, which can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>
be discerned when about ten miles from Aigues Mortes,
grows bigger and bigger, till at last the strange, rude,
characteristic outline of the lonely church by the sea
fascinates and holds the eye till one reaches it after the
36 kilometres of desert.
</p>

<p>
The shrine of the three holy women is visited every
year by hundreds of pilgrims, and many a sick person is
cured by the power of the relics, say the curé and the
Catholic Church&mdash;by the not less astonishing potency of
the "unconscious mind" assert the more advanced of
the modern schools of mental science.
</p>

<p>
The curé said that he had seen several hundred cures.
Many paralytics and those who had been bitten by mad
dogs came on this pilgrimage, and he had known only two
cases of failure. The bones of Mary, mother of Jacob,
and of her daughter, Mary Salomé, with those of their
servant Sara, are all preserved in a richly painted
reliquary, which is let down among the people from its
shrine above the tribune. This is the moment of
salvation, and hundreds of arms are stretched imploringly
towards it, and hundreds of voices are raised in supplication;
and judging by the many well-authenticated
accounts some mysterious healing power is actually set
in motion.
</p>

<p>
Anything more forlorn than the little village that has
grown up around the church is difficult to imagine.
There is not a soul stirring, and scarcely a sound is to be
heard indicating human life. The Camargue stretches
to westward. The sea beats on the sandy beach a little
way beyond the village square. One hears the waves
quietly running in upon the shore. In the middle of the
square stands an ancient carved stone cross. The people
of the place have the reputation of being rude and almost
savage, and their ignorance is said to be incredible.
</p>

<p>
The exterior of Les Saintes Maries is rude, warlike,

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' name='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
even sterner in aspect than Maguelonne, and it stands
bare and solitary on this desert spot with not a tree or a
green thing near it; only the spectral, thinly clad, unearthly
looking trees of the Camargue dimly in sight here
and there in the grey distance.
</p>

<p>
The door of the church was open, and we entered.
Again, as in Maguelonne, great arches and apses, sombre,
religious, primitive, the candles and artificial flowers with
which the altars were decked for Christmas standing out
pathetically against the gloom.
</p>

<p>
In one of the side chapels the curé was busy painting
the background of a <i>crèche</i>. He was occupied with the
Star in the East when we arrived, and was so absorbed
that he did not hear our footsteps. When we came
nearer he turned and descended from the ladder on which
he had mounted, explaining that he had been appointed
to the cure only a few months and found to his dismay
that the benighted inhabitants had never in all their lives
had a <i>crèche</i> at Christmas! So he was busying himself
to redeem them from this state of spiritual darkness.
The palm-trees and <i>la sainte vierge</i> were expected to-morrow
from Nimes. <i>Le Christ</i> had already arrived.
</p>

<p>
The curé went forward to give a touch to the manger
as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Vous voyez les vaches&mdash;qu'elles sont jolies!" He
stood back to contemplate them. The boy who had
conducted us to the church remained gazing in dumb
admiration, and though he was peremptorily sent on a
message by the curé, he returned almost at once to gaze
anew, which brought down on him an impatient reproof.
</p>

<p>
"Va t'en, va t'en; qu'est-ce que tu fais la avec ta
bouche grand-ouverte; sauve toi donc!"
</p>

<p>
And poor Jules had to shut his mouth and tear himself
away from the alluring scene.

reliquary containing the bones of the saints, which were
saved from peril at the time of the great Revolution by
the faithful curé of that day, who took out the precious
relics from the chests, leaving in their place some ordinary
bones and hiding the real ones, which were afterwards
replaced with great pomp when the danger was over.
</p>

<p>
The roof is formed of stone slabs, the same as that of
Maguelonne, and the view from it is as extensive but far
more solitary.
</p>

<p>
"La mer indéfinie, l'éternelle limite blanche à l'horizon,
et la lande, toujours, aux salicornes basses et aux tamaris
clairsemés. C'est une heure exquise de mélancholie, de
pieux idéal ... l'immense arène jaune bordeé par la mer
bleu et l'horizon de sable; les lagunes nageés dans une
brume lumineuse d'ou rien ne surgit que vers le nord-est,
le pic Saint Loup, comme une fantôme."
</p>

<p class="p2">
We left this lonely church with the twilight falling
upon it, and the evening silence. In the village square
little whirls of loose sand were coming up from the beach
with the gusts of wind, harbingers of a coming mistral,
and one could hear always in the strange quiet, the beat
and retreat of the waves.

CHAPTER XXVII
</p>

<p class="center">"ARTISTS IN HAPPINESS"
</p>

<p>
It is doubtful if there is a country in Europe where the
spirit of the past is so strong as it is in Provence.
</p>

<p>
One needs not to dive down for it below the surface;
it lives before one's eyes everywhere, every day. That
strange cheer and blitheness that seems to belong to the
centuries gone by has not yet been beaten down by the
care and heaviness of modern life. The mere act of
living is still joyful, the zest and charm of simple things
still survives among the people. They live without
hurry, yet they work to good purpose; far more quickly
and efficiently than in England.
</p>

<p>
They seem to work hard, yet without toil; no doubt
because they know also how to play.
</p>

<p>
This has all to be said with reservations, however, for
the modern spirit is stealing into the country; it is like
the little edge of the earth's shadow when the moon
begins to be eclipsed. But the old is still dominant and
will not easily be destroyed.
</p>

<p>
It is not merely the world of yesterday, of the Middle
Ages that lingers, but&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;the world of
the ancients. That is half the secret of the country.
</p>

<p>
It is this element that underlies and mingles so quaintly
with the picturesque side of religious mediævalism. No
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_404' name='Page_404' href='#Page_404'>404</a></span>
wonder men and women have passionately tried to
recover the charm of that old, fresh, lost world. Perhaps
that is why the Renaissance is so endlessly fascinating.
It was a wild, brilliant, vain attempt to find happiness
and the real goal of human life.
</p>

<p>
Men may indeed be turned from their natural quest by
some harsh faith or blinding habit, but the hunger of the
heart never leaves them.
</p>

<p>
One is constrained to believe in the possibility of a fresh
Renaissance that will bring us further on our way towards
the gates of Paradise, for have we not learnt since that
earlier attempt, that happiness must be built on happiness,
not on sacrifice and burnt offerings? This at least
is certain: human cruelty leads to human woe. The
misery and the cruelty below the glitter of a brilliant
civilisation gnaws like some evil creature at its heart.
</p>

<p>
<i>There</i> was the flaw in that splendid claim on life made
by the men and women of the Renaissance. Each age
brings its contributions and commits its errors. But it
is stupid to go on committing the old errors over and
over again.
</p>

<p>
Maulde de la Clavière describes the attitude of the
women during all these times of movement, which is very
curious, very subtle, and very modern. "Properly to
understand their spiritual condition," he says, "we should
have to do as they did: solve the problem of feminism in
the feminine way; be women, and more than women&mdash;arch-women.
It was the conviction of all the sons of
the Renaissance," he goes on, "that sentiment has higher
lights than reason, and that certain intuitions of the
heart unfold to us, as in bygone days to Socrates, horizons
hitherto beyond our ken&mdash;a foretaste of the divine....
And now the new generations were no longer willing to
regard earthly happiness as an illusion, ... and flattered
themselves on finding a means of building life upon liberty....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' name='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span>
People wished to live henceforth under a calm and
radiant sky; they talked of taking the gifts of God as
they found them, idealising everything. From that time
it belongs truly to women to govern the higher world,
the realm of sentiment.... So many noble things lack
the sap of life! They will give that sap, that vitality,
that soul. The sap of love brings grapes from thorns.
And thereby the transformation of the world is to be
achieved."
</p>

<p>
In short, women were to take life into their hands and
turn it into a fine art. They were to become priestesses
in the Temple of the World, and the object of worship
was to be the Beautiful. They were to become the
creators of no less a thing than happiness. Our author
quotes Ruskin's saying about a woman that "the violets
should not droop when she passes, but burst into
flower."
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Love is the sum of genius," the writer further quotes from
Schiller, <i>apropos</i> of this astonishing outbreak of romantic thought.
"The formula," he says, "is this: to live, that is, to love life, to
attain a mastery of life, without allowing it to crush or dominate
us.... In those days they sincerely studied to love life; they loved
it, rejecting all negations and obstructions, all that overwhelms and
paralyses...."
</p>
</div>

<p>
To treat existence&mdash;as some tried to treat it in the
sixteenth century in Italy&mdash;from the point of view of the
artist, must at least bring rich fruits&mdash;though it depends
perilously upon the artist!
</p>

<p>
It was to the newly liberated women of the chivalrous
age that all instinctively turned for the realisation of the
universal longing. It was for them to add some treasure
to the world that they had so lately entered. And more
was done than perhaps we shall ever realise to make life
liveable and human by the women of the troubadour
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_406' name='Page_406' href='#Page_406'>406</a></span>
days and their successors of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries.
</p>

<p>
Unhappily they lived too near to barbaric times, with
the blood of mediæval savages still running in their veins,
to be able to understand one essential ingredient in the
magic philtre that they sought so eagerly.
</p>

<p>
They could not follow the counsel of their historian,
who says "the woman must steep her hands in beauty,
fill her eyes with love, and then look at things
courageously and truthfully."<a name='FA_33' id='FA_33' href='#FN_33' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a> They followed and
worshipped Beauty, but they terribly sinned against
Love.
</p>

<p>
"The first duty of woman," the author says, "is to
exhibit in themselves every lovable quality."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! is that all?" asked Barbara, with genial
sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"They overlaid life," he adds, "with that varnish of
wonderful singular sweetness which has never been
wholly rubbed off."
</p>

<p>
Barbara listened in silence, whilst I read on.
</p>

<p>
"Love, and go straight on your way&mdash;that is the new
formula&mdash;a very effective one, since it converts dogmas
into sentiments." Again this definition: "The kingdom
of God&mdash;that is a state in which every one's actions
would be prompted by love."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds nice," said Barbara, with a sceptical note
in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"All the possible definitions of beauty apply also to
life; life and beauty are one and the same thing."
</p>

<p>
Barbara demurred at this.
</p>

<p>
But, after all, the somewhat grim-looking family
which she adduced as refutation were really not exactly
alive in any serious sense of the word. Truly living
people are <i>always</i> in some way beautiful. I left her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_407' name='Page_407' href='#Page_407'>407</a></span>
pondering this risky statement while I prudently
hastened on.
</p>

<p>
Our gallant author seemed to see things after a
fashion of his own. One might, of course, summarily
dismiss it as sentimentalism, but that would be meaningless,
for our whole life is founded on sentiment of one
kind and another. It is monstrous without it.
</p>

<p>
"He seems to think sentiment very important; more
so than most men do," said Barbara, whose male relatives
were mostly of a solid order.
</p>

<p>
A proverb, he points out, says that "one does not die
of love: perhaps not; but what we know with absolute
certainty, what stares us everywhere in the face in
letters of fire and blood, is that one dies of the absence
of love."
</p>

<p>
And it is always to women he looks for the founding
of the gentler dispensation. He really does seem to
appreciate us! He declares that we are one and all,
without exception, "artists in happiness!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! then he has never met Aunt Rebecca," said
Barbara conclusively.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Only a few more days in Provence were now before
us, and we had worked our way across country to the
main line at Arles for the homeward journey.
</p>

<p>
It was a pleasure to find ourselves again in that strange
flat country of the Crau and the Camargue, with the grey
city on its hill above the Rhone.
</p>

<p>
We were wearied with the mad, sad doings of men and
turned to the natural features of the surrounding country
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_408' name='Page_408' href='#Page_408'>408</a></span>
for rest and relief. And they did not fail us as far as
interest was concerned. Only they, too, had their dramas
and their tragedies. Those strange solitudes had a wild
and stirring past; while the vast lagoons at the Rhone's
mouth have a long story all to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Whole volumes have been written about their formation
and the geological romance of this brilliant coast.
Once, as we have seen, the Mediterranean washed the
cliffs at Beaucaire and Nimes, and swept up to the base
of the Alpilles. The country, in truth, seems to have
retained something of the sea-song in its wide reminiscent
spaces.
</p>

<p>
There were deluges and avalanches, and all sorts of
exciting events of mountain and river; the Rhone and
the Durance playing the principal parts in this melodrama
of the elements. Those impulsive heroes carried
off vast masses of stone and rubble from the mountains
and covered the low-lying land with the "wreckage of
the Alps."
</p>

<p>
Then the secondary characters trooped along: the
Herault, the Ley, and other streams, and they helped to
heap up great bars at the river's mouth, so that the
monster could not find his way to the sea without much
uneasy wandering; and always as he wandered, murmuring
angrily, more and more mud and stones were
deposited to heighten the bars. And so with the passing
of the centuries the great lagoons were formed so big and
blue that the unwary traveller nearing Arles may almost
mistake them for the Mediterranean. When at last the
sea is found, there is another flinging down of Alpine
spoils, for the difference in the weight and in the
temperature of the salt and the river waters at their
meeting, causes the river to drop what it carries rapidly&mdash;perhaps
in joy at this final home-coming to the brightest
of all seas.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' name='Page_409' href='#Page_409'>409</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Louis XIV., it appears, built miles and miles of dykes,
and Adam de Craponne accomplished wonders of engineering
work, and has become one of the heroes of
Provençal history; but still the waters now and again
come down in floods and do terrible damage. Indeed
engineers are beginning to think that the system of
dykes is a mistaken one, for by confining the river within
narrow limits, the force is enormously concentrated and
presses on the dykes, while there is always a tendency to
raise the bed by the deposits.
</p>

<p>
Consequently the danger is constantly increased by the
very means they have taken to avert it.
</p>

<p>
"C'est comme une grande passion. Le Rhone a
toujours été audessus des forces de l'homme."
</p>

<p>
So must have thought the poor woman and her
husband, guardians of the shattered bridge of St.
Bénézet at Avignon, for they told us that the flood had
risen to the second storey of their house. And this happened,
and was bound to happen at intervals, when the
ice broke up in the mountains. The Government might
raise the dykes at vast expense till it was tired; the river
rose too. Better let it spread quietly over the land and
enrich it. But now the system was begun it could not
be abandoned. Very dangerous it would seem, a big
river&mdash;or a big passion! And if ever there was a big
passion that river is possessed by it!
</p>

<p>
No dream too lovely, no joy too perfect to be within
the scope of human destiny while the spirit is held by
the incantation of those waters.
</p>

<p>
All things are possible! That is the song of the
Rhone.
</p>

<p>
It knows so much, this child of the mountains, born to
all the secrets of solitary places, and laden now with the
sad, strange lore of its journeyings by city and strand, by
quiet lands where the plough traces glistening furrows in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' name='Page_410' href='#Page_410'>410</a></span>
the slant morning light, and the vines throw their arms
to the sun with all the grace and all the enchantment
that made men drunk in the old days when not one of
them was afraid to be happy.
</p>

<p>
The race lived in communion with the things of the
soil and the heavens, so that their religion was an ecstatic
sense of life and beauty; "that tingling in the veins
sympathetic with the yearning life of the earth, which
apparently in all times and places prompted some mode
of wild dancing."
</p>

<p>
Of the Bacchanalia we still have the fury and the
terror, hidden in dark places, poisoning existence, but the
splendour and the grace, the sweet freshness of those
wild festivals are banished from the earth. How much
of beauty they have given to the world only an artist or
a poet here and there understands.
</p>

<p>
"It is from this fantastic scene," says one of the
fraternity, "that the beautiful wind-touched draperies,
the rhythm, the heads suddenly thrown back, of many
a Pompeian wall-painting and sarcophagus frieze are
originally derived." And the same eye sees in the figure
of Dionysus the "mystical and fiery spirit of the earth&mdash;the
aroma of the green world is retained in the fair
human body." "Sweet upon the mountains" is the
presence of the far-wandering god "who embodies all
the voluptuous abundance of Asia, its beating sun, its
fair-towered cities."
</p>

<p>
To see the sun shining through the classic vine-leaves
in a southern land, is to begin to understand the emotions
of the people who gave birth to the myth of
Dionysus; and we may "think we see the green festoons
of the vine dropping quickly from foot-place to foot-place
down the broken hill-side in the spring."
</p>

<p>
Some mirage of the ancient world comes to us with
the picture. And laughter&mdash;laughter, which was "an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' name='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
essential element of the earlier worship of Dionysus,"
seems to be shaking the tendrils in some half literal, half
symbolical fashion. The living curves, the little merry
whirls and spirals are full of it.
</p>

<p>
The vine and the graver ivy crowned the white brow
of Dionysus, plants dear to the Hamadryads, "spinning
or weaving with airiest fingers, the foliage of the trees,
the petals of the flowers, the skins of the fruits, the
long thin stalks on which the poplar leaves are set so
lightly that Homer compares them, in their constant
motion, to the maids who sit spinning in the house of
Alcinous."
</p>

<p>
And by road and river are great growths of reeds, the
plant of Dionysus and the merry satyrs who make their
pipes from the hollow stems.
</p>

<p>
It was surely this beautiful province of a beautiful land
that inspired the first conscious determined effort towards
the art of living that has been made by man since an evil
fate had plunged him into the awful martyrdom of the
Middle Ages. The spirit that came into being at that
auspicious hour lingers like a presence. It is not due
merely to bright sky and clear air. There are skies as
blue and air as clear in lands where the very stones
breathe forth tragedy. The Campagna of Rome is a
case in point, nor is the siren country about the Bay of
Naples untouched by this under-shadow.
</p>

<p>
Even here indeed, in Provence itself, the deep wound
in the heart of Life inflicted by mediæval superstition
has never quite ceased to bleed, and the country seems at
moments to sadden and grow chill in the face of the sun;
but this is the tribute paid to the spiritual Cæsar of the
new Empire, and does not spring from the ancient genius
of the country.
</p>

<p>
That genius presses upon the imagination, as if some
hidden intelligence were playing the part of generous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' name='Page_412' href='#Page_412'>412</a></span>
host, and sending forth the parting guest laden with
gifts and valedictions.
</p>

<p>
These invisible hosts have no regard for any timid
dread of enthusiasm and faith. They boldly whisper of
a new Creed and Cult, a Temple of Happiness to be set
up even in our own indignant land!
</p>

<p>
They are quite unabashed at the audacity of the proposition;
at doubts and limitations they laugh.
</p>

<p>
But the leave-taking traveller knows that he is under
a spell, and asks himself if these dreams of powers and
destinies will live under grey skies, grey creeds and
customs.
</p>

<p>
Here it is easy to believe in exquisite audacities.
</p>

<p>
"Here a thousand hamlets laugh by the river-side, our
skies laugh; everything is happy, everything lives," as
the poet Jasmin sings of his native land.
</p>

<p>
At once inspiring and restful! This perfect balance
is possible. Supremely good things may be in contrast
but not in contradiction. So at least one believes in
Provence.
</p>

<p>
The parting guest thinks wistfully of that delicious
journey down stream, of the happy company in the
<i>Caburle</i>, in Mistral's Poem of the Rhone; the old
barge drifting with the current through the very heart
of the country of Romance. Every city and hamlet,
every bridge and ruin, the scene of a thousand
stories....
</p>

<p>
He remembers with what an outburst the poet sings of
the towers of Avignon, as the barge comes in sight of the
city, flame-tinted with the setting sun:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"e pinto</p>
<p>De resplendour reialo e purpurenco</p>
<p>Es Avignoun e lou Palais di Papo!</p>
<p>Avignoun! Avignoun sus sa grand Roco!</p>
<p>Avignoun, la galoio campaniero...."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' name='Page_413' href='#Page_413'>413</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">("et pient</p>
<p>De splendeur royale, de pourpre splendide</p>
<p>C'est&mdash;Avignon et le Palais des Papes,</p>
<p>Avignon sur sa Roque géante!</p>
<p>Avignon la sonneuse de la joie.")</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>
Always that word! Joie, joie! One meets it in story,
in song, in the voices of the people. Provence must
certainly have been its birthplace&mdash;or its sanctuary.
</p>

<p>
Driven from every other land, when the Goddess of
Sorrow came to usurp the temples of the ancient gods,
reviled, feared, stricken to the heart, the beautiful
fugitive at last found shelter in the land of Love and
Chivalry.
</p>

<p class="center p4">

<div class='footnote' id='FN_7'>
<p>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_7'>[7]</a></span> It is a curious fact, and somewhat difficult for the Western mind
to realise, that just at this darkest moment of European history&mdash;or
at any rate during the three later centuries of the period&mdash;the woman
of Japan "held a higher social and intellectual rank than she then
did in any other part of the world."
</p>

<p>
In an interesting work on "Feudal and Modern Japan," by Arthur
May Knapp, occur the following arresting passages:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Aston also, in speaking of the fact that the author of this classic"
(the "Jôsa Nikki") "professes to write as a woman, calls attention
to the extraordinarily preponderant influence of woman in the field
of ancient Japanese literature. It has long been recognised that
woman occupies a much higher place in Japan than in any other
Oriental country, but it is none the less surprising, especially in view
of the supposed lack of intelligence among the sex in Japan to-day,
to be told that by far the larger number of works of the best age of
Japanese literature were of feminine authorship."
</p>

<p>
The writer quotes from the transactions of the Asiatic Society of
Japan to the same effect: "that a very large proportion of the best
writings of the best age of Japanese literature was the work of
women."
</p>

<p>
This golden age in Japan was from the eighth to the eleventh century.
During that time the men were chiefly engaged in pedantic
studies in Chinese, while the women were developing a native and
living literature. And during that time and for centuries before, the
women of the West had not so much as arrived at the possession of
human rights worthy the name!

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
